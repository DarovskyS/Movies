3
00:00:22.622 --> 00:00:26.251

00:00:36.068 --> 00:00:37.558
<i>It's cozy, safe,</i>

00:00:37.637 --> 00:00:40.765

10
00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:42.171
<i>Not for you?</i>

11
00:00:42.241 --> 00:00:45.574

this is the one<br/>I was talking about.

37
00:02:03.122 --> 00:02:06.250
It's a historical home<br/>on one of the best blocks

38
00:02:06.325 --> 00:02:07.917

Oh, the kitchen's<br/>a little small.

42

Well, rip out this<br/>awful room divider,

43
00:02:17.202 --> 00:02:19.636
and you've got<br/>an eat-in kitchen.

44
00:02:19.704 --> 00:02:22.468
And over here<br/>you have your library.

45
00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:23.199
Wow.

46
00:02:23.274 --> 00:02:24.366

Oh, you like books?

48
00:02:25.677 --> 00:02:29.204
I have a little collection<br/>of first-edition novels.

So, this staircase.<br/>This leads to where?

53
00:02:55.006 --> 00:02:57.975
I thought you realized.<br/>This is a duplex.

54
00:02:58.043 --> 00:03:00.841
As in two floors<br/>for the price of one?

55
00:03:00.912 --> 00:03:04.075
I believe it's right there<br/>in the listing sheet.

56
00:03:04.149 --> 00:03:05.616
So, why was it sealed off?

57
00:03:05.683 --> 00:03:09.084
Were there, like, a slew of<br/>murders up there or something?

58
00:03:09.154 --> 00:03:12.612
No, there's just a sweet, little<br/>old lady that lives upstairs.

59
00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:14.521

60
00:03:14.592 --> 00:03:15.286
Mm-hmm.

61
00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:18.158
So, rent control means<br/>we can't kick her out, right?

62
00:03:18.229 --> 00:03:19.457
Alex!

63
00:03:19.531 --> 00:03:22.091
That's a legitimate question.<br/>You cannot evict her.

I don't feel too good, Kenneth.

83

You have a Mommy-and-Me<br/>park over here.

You got shopping that way.

97

And surprisingly affordable.

98
00:05:03.334 --> 00:05:04.392
It's kind of affordable.

99
00:05:04.469 --> 00:05:07.029
It's really at the high end<br/>of our price range.

100

00:36:35.791 --> 00:36:38.851
I just wanted my friends<br/>to have a look-see.

698
00:36:38.928 --> 00:36:41.396
You were supposed to be<br/>at the church performing.

699
00:36:41.463 --> 00:36:44.159
Heavens no.<br/>It's next Friday.

700
00:36:44.233 --> 00:36:46.997
We've got a big week<br/>of practice ahead of us.

701
00:36:47.069 --> 00:36:48.934
You terrified the poor woman.

702
00:36:49.004 --> 00:36:51.495
Mrs. Connelly, you can press<br/>charges if you want.

703
00:36:51.574 --> 00:36:53.166
No, I don't want to do that.

704
00:36:53.242 --> 00:36:56.336
They're such a nice couple.<br/>Good night, now.

705
00:36:56.412 --> 00:36:58.505
Good night, Mrs. Connelly.

706
00:37:00.749 --> 00:37:04.947
I'm gonna be watching<br/>the two of you very closely.

707
00:37:07.890 --> 00:37:10.484
- Hey, Alex, right?<br/>- Hey, Chick.

708
00:37:10.559 --> 00:37:13.187
How you doing?<br/>Brought you a housewarming gift.

709
00:37:13.262 --> 00:37:14.593
Oh, that's so sweet.

710
00:37:14.663 --> 00:37:18.064
Well, look,<br/>this is very tasteful stuff.

711
00:37:18.133 --> 00:37:19.327
You know, for couples.

712
00:37:19.401 --> 00:37:22.700
That is so thoughtful.<br/>Thank you.

713
00:37:22.771 --> 00:37:25.296
My card's inside "Ass Patrol,"<br/>in case you need more.

714
00:37:25.374 --> 00:37:26.341
Take it easy.

715
00:37:26.408 --> 00:37:28.273
- Thanks for the party.<br/>- Okay.

716
00:37:28.344 --> 00:37:30.938
I got an award for this one.

717
00:37:42.691 --> 00:37:44.318
She was supposed to be<br/>at church.

718
00:37:44.393 --> 00:37:46.623
You can't fire me<br/>because you got maced.

719
00:37:46.695 --> 00:37:48.390
Believe me.

720
00:37:48.464 --> 00:37:51.365
I wish that's why<br/>I was firing you.

721
00:37:51.433 --> 00:37:56.336
Did you happen to see<br/>the restaurant hot list?

722
00:38:03.512 --> 00:38:05.571
Oh, my God.

723
00:38:09.084 --> 00:38:10.381
So...

724
00:38:11.920 --> 00:38:14.787
How's Mr. Peabody doing?

725
00:38:20.796 --> 00:38:22.730
Alex?

726
00:38:22.798 --> 00:38:25.266
Oh.<br/>Oh, no, no, no.

727
00:38:25.334 --> 00:38:27.063
There's no napping right now.

728
00:38:27.136 --> 00:38:30.663
You have to finish your book.<br/>We need money. I got fired.

729
00:38:30.739 --> 00:38:32.604
Yeah, I know.<br/>I saw it.

730
00:38:32.675 --> 00:38:35.974
Oh, you saw it.

731
00:38:36.045 --> 00:38:39.139
Yeah. It's horrible.<br/>My parents read this magazine.

732
00:38:39.214 --> 00:38:42.615
Now they know my penis<br/>is called Mr. Peabody.

733
00:38:42.685 --> 00:38:44.312
It wasn't my fault.

734
00:38:44.386 --> 00:38:46.946
She was calling me<br/>when you were napping.

735
00:38:47.022 --> 00:38:50.253
I wasn't napping,<br/>for the 1,000th time!

736
00:38:50.325 --> 00:38:52.816
Okay, maybe I took a nap<br/>at one point.

737
00:38:52.895 --> 00:38:54.920
When did napping<br/>become against the law?

738
00:38:54.997 --> 00:38:58.831
Honey, I can't work here. It's<br/>impossible. I've been trying.

739
00:38:58.901 --> 00:39:01.233
I've written three pages<br/>in the last six weeks.

740
00:39:01.303 --> 00:39:03.703
Three pages.<br/>The book is due on Wednesday.

741
00:39:03.772 --> 00:39:06.798
If we don't hand in the book, I<br/>don't know what we're gonna do.

742
00:39:06.875 --> 00:39:09.469
We can't pay for anything.<br/>The runners, the stools.

743
00:39:09.545 --> 00:39:11.809
We can't pay for the<br/>tangelo bowl you like.

744
00:39:11.880 --> 00:39:16.647
We can't pay for your<br/>little happy mug-vase thing.

745
00:39:16.719 --> 00:39:18.880
Well, what if you<br/>got out of the house

746
00:39:18.954 --> 00:39:22.253
and went to write at, like,<br/>a Starbucks or something?

747
00:39:22.324 --> 00:39:24.952
And what? You're gonna stay here<br/>and try to find work

748
00:39:25.027 --> 00:39:28.326
while she has you running around<br/>doing things for her?

749
00:39:28.397 --> 00:39:32.390
Doing all the little errands,<br/>the chores she asks you to do?

750
00:39:32.468 --> 00:39:34.459
I don't think you could take it.

751
00:39:34.536 --> 00:39:37.630
I mean, I love you,<br/>but, honestly,

752
00:39:37.706 --> 00:39:40.539
I've been there, and I don't<br/>think you could take it.

753
00:39:41.543 --> 00:39:43.443
I can take it.<br/>I'll be fine.

[Brass instruments playing]

755
00:40:02.364 --> 00:40:04.127
Nancy?

756
00:40:05.901 --> 00:40:07.835
- Hello, Mrs. Connelly.<br/>- Nancy, dear.

757
00:40:07.903 --> 00:40:12.101
I couldn't help noticing that<br/>Alex left the house this morning

758
00:40:12.174 --> 00:40:13.698
while you stayed home.

759
00:40:13.776 --> 00:40:16.336
I was downsized from my job.

760
00:40:16.411 --> 00:40:18.777
Aw, I'm sorry.

761
00:40:18.847 --> 00:40:20.678
But I'm sure it's for the best.

762
00:40:20.749 --> 00:40:24.685
Let Mr. Rose get out there<br/>and bring home the bacon.

763
00:40:24.753 --> 00:40:26.380
I always thought it was strange.

764
00:40:26.455 --> 00:40:30.687
A husband staying home while<br/>you were out there providing.

765
00:40:30.759 --> 00:40:31.919
Well, he's a writer.

766
00:40:31.994 --> 00:40:33.655
Writer.

767
00:40:33.729 --> 00:40:37.495
The man naps more<br/>than a newborn pup.

768
00:40:37.566 --> 00:40:40.126
What's he writing about?<br/>Sheep?

769
00:40:40.202 --> 00:40:42.193
Is there something,<br/>Mrs. Connelly?

770
00:40:42.271 --> 00:40:45.536
Oh, I guess you could say<br/>there was something.

771
00:40:45.607 --> 00:40:49.202
I've got something on display<br/>in me kitchen.

772
00:40:51.113 --> 00:40:53.047
That is not a mouse dropping.

773
00:40:53.115 --> 00:40:54.844
It's a raisin.

774
00:40:54.917 --> 00:40:58.216
That is the leavings<br/>of a mouse.

775
00:40:58.287 --> 00:41:00.448
It's a raisin.

776
00:41:04.927 --> 00:41:08.124
I sprayed it with Lysol.

777
00:41:10.833 --> 00:41:11.993
Ohh.

778
00:41:12.067 --> 00:41:16.367
And she puts on this sweet face,<br/>and she acts all innocent.

779
00:41:17.072 --> 00:41:20.132
Nancy, could you help me?

780
00:41:21.076 --> 00:41:24.045
I think I found<br/>the leavings of a mouse.

781
00:41:26.215 --> 00:41:28.342
As if she didn't know<br/>it was a raisin.

782
00:41:28.417 --> 00:41:29.645
I know.

783
00:41:38.927 --> 00:41:42.522
I've never designed<br/>religious leaflets, per se.

786
00:41:46.435 --> 00:41:48.300
Okay.

787
00:41:48.370 --> 00:41:50.600
Nancy?

788
00:41:50.672 --> 00:41:53.869
Nancy?<br/>Are you down there?

789
00:41:55.344 --> 00:41:56.811
What is it, Mrs. Connelly?

790
00:41:56.879 --> 00:42:00.713
Little Dickey's caught<br/>in the dumbwaiter shaft.

791
00:42:00.782 --> 00:42:03.250
Well, how did he get there?

792
00:42:03.318 --> 00:42:04.307
Aaah!

793
00:42:05.487 --> 00:42:08.456
Oh, don't hurt him.

794
00:42:12.127 --> 00:42:14.391
Oh, ooh, Dickey boy.

795
00:42:14.463 --> 00:42:16.556
Oh, careful.

796
00:42:16.632 --> 00:42:18.964
Aah!

797
00:42:20.068 --> 00:42:21.729
Shame on you.

800
00:42:28.577 --> 00:42:30.010
This is not going well.

801
00:42:30.078 --> 00:42:33.070
I told you she's a mean,<br/>crafty old lady.

802
00:42:33.148 --> 00:42:35.343
At this rate, I'm never gonna<br/>finish the book in time.

803
00:42:35.417 --> 00:42:37.009
Damn rent control.

804
00:42:37.085 --> 00:42:39.349
I wish we could just<br/>kick her out.

805
00:42:39.421 --> 00:42:41.753
What if we tried<br/>being nice to her?

806
00:42:41.823 --> 00:42:44.485
Maybe we could get her a gift.

807
00:42:44.559 --> 00:42:45.787
- A gift?<br/>- Yeah.

808
00:42:45.861 --> 00:42:49.160
And ask her if<br/>she wouldn't mind leaving.

809
00:42:49.231 --> 00:42:50.823
- We ask her?<br/>- Yeah.

810
00:42:50.899 --> 00:42:52.127
Just ask her?

811
00:42:52.200 --> 00:42:55.727
Maybe it'll take<br/>a little begging, but nicely.

812
00:42:56.772 --> 00:42:58.637
Well, she might go for begging.

813
00:43:07.516 --> 00:43:12.146
There's a chart that shows<br/>what's inside of each chocolate.

814
00:43:12.220 --> 00:43:14.017
That's all right, dear.

815

00:43:17.092 --> 00:43:19.890
Alex and I are trying<br/>to have a baby.

817
00:43:19.962 --> 00:43:21.486

In the living room.

819
00:43:23.365 --> 00:43:25.299
Right.

820
00:43:25.367 --> 00:43:27.665
The thing is,<br/>when we do have our baby,

821
00:43:27.736 --> 00:43:29.966
we're gonna need the upstairs.

822
00:43:30.038 --> 00:43:32.472
I don't understand, dear.

823
00:43:32.541 --> 00:43:35.874
We're willing to pay you<br/>something.

824
00:43:35.944 --> 00:43:37.502
You want me to leave?

825
00:43:37.579 --> 00:43:39.809
Don't you think<br/>you'd be more comfortable

826
00:43:39.881 --> 00:43:44.341
with people who are more<br/>in your demographic?

827
00:43:44.419 --> 00:43:48.355
In sunny Miami Beach.

828
00:43:50.192 --> 00:43:54.322
I'm Irish.<br/>I'd sizzle up like a sausage.

829
00:43:54.396 --> 00:43:58.628
Besides, this is my home.

830
00:43:58.700 --> 00:43:59.496

833
00:44:09.244 --> 00:44:13.010
Well, now, there's a thought.

834
00:44:13.081 --> 00:44:17.518
I haven't been back home<br/>for 50 years.

835
00:44:18.487 --> 00:44:19.419

00:44:33.001 --> 00:44:35.060

And you moving there.

839
00:44:38.240 --> 00:44:42.267
Most likely<br/>they have television now?

840
00:44:42.344 --> 00:44:43.038
Oh.

841
00:44:43.111 --> 00:44:44.100
Of course they do.

842
00:44:44.179 --> 00:44:45.771
Yeah, color.

843
00:44:55.657 --> 00:44:58.353

00:45:35.063 --> 00:45:36.496
Alex, what are you doing?

858
00:45:36.565 --> 00:45:37.497
CPR!

859
00:45:37.566 --> 00:45:40.558
Wait! Stop it!<br/>Stop it!

Oh, God.<br/>One, two, three, four, five.

861
00:45:45.740 --> 00:45:47.935
Okay, give her mouth-to-mouth.

862
00:45:48.009 --> 00:45:50.341
- Oh, no. Really?<br/>- Yes. Yes, do it!

863
00:45:50.412 --> 00:45:51.674
Okay.

864
00:45:52.681 --> 00:45:56.344
No, you got to blow<br/>in her mouth. Come on.

865
00:45:56.418 --> 00:45:57.680
One breath, come on.

Okay, again.

Again!

00:46:17.405 --> 00:46:18.804
Oh.

872
00:46:18.874 --> 00:46:20.865
[Gasps]

873
00:46:22.410 --> 00:46:25.379
What are you doing?

874
00:46:26.715 --> 00:46:29.775
You were choking on a chocolate.

875
00:46:31.319 --> 00:46:33.150
You choked on a chocolate.

876
00:46:36.791 --> 00:46:38.816
Oh.

877
00:46:39.728 --> 00:46:43.164
Oh. Oh.

878
00:46:43.732 --> 00:46:45.825
Go on, Mrs. Connelly.

879
00:46:45.901 --> 00:46:50.395
The last thing I remember,<br/>I ate one of their chocolates.

880
00:46:50.472 --> 00:46:54.909
And when I woke up,<br/>he was having his way.

881
00:46:54.976 --> 00:46:57.001
And she was holding me down.

882
00:46:57.078 --> 00:46:58.909
No, I was trying<br/>to save her life.

883
00:46:58.980 --> 00:47:03.940
He stole me drawers once<br/>for sniffing.

884
00:47:04.019 --> 00:47:05.043
That's ridiculous.

885
00:47:05.120 --> 00:47:07.554
She was choking on the<br/>chocolate, so I did...

886
00:47:07.622 --> 00:47:09.988
Shut up!

887
00:47:10.058 --> 00:47:13.186
We keep a list of people like<br/>you down here at the station.

888
00:47:13.261 --> 00:47:15.695
The sexual predator list.

889
00:47:15.764 --> 00:47:17.755
Sexual predator?

890
00:47:17.832 --> 00:47:21.791
And to think<br/>they want to have children.

891
00:47:22.971 --> 00:47:24.905
We should've just let her choke.

892
00:47:25.040 --> 00:47:27.133
Oh, I know.

893
00:47:40.155 --> 00:47:41.645
What can I get you?

894
00:47:41.723 --> 00:47:43.987
Listen, I got 12 hours<br/>to finish this book.

895
00:47:44.059 --> 00:47:46.323
I was wondering if I could<br/>sit here and write all day.

896
00:47:46.394 --> 00:47:48.521
- Be my guest.<br/>- Thanks.

897
00:48:01.042 --> 00:48:02.907
CONNELLY:<br/>Nancy.

898
00:48:02.978 --> 00:48:05.310
I was going to ring you.

899
00:48:05.380 --> 00:48:09.646
I'm afraid there's a bit<br/>of a problem up here.

900
00:48:09.718 --> 00:48:12.812
I have to go on a job interview,<br/>so I'll take care of it later.

901
00:48:12.887 --> 00:48:16.687
Oh, that's okay.<br/>I'll ring the rug man.

902
00:48:23.832 --> 00:48:26.130
Good.<br/>Knock it in.

903
00:48:26.201 --> 00:48:27.793
Knock it in good.

904
00:48:27.869 --> 00:48:30.804
I don't want to slip<br/>and break me neck.

905
00:48:30.872 --> 00:48:32.703
No, we wouldn't want that.

906
00:48:32.774 --> 00:48:35.538
This is the problem area here.

907
00:48:35.610 --> 00:48:38.306
It's loose as a Dublin whore.

908
00:48:38.380 --> 00:48:41.213
Oh, go on, knock it in.

909
00:48:45.220 --> 00:48:47.017
Yes!

910
00:48:48.023 --> 00:48:49.957
Now, just knock it in.

911
00:48:50.025 --> 00:48:51.993
Go on, knock.

912
00:48:52.060 --> 00:48:54.460
Come on, use some elbow grease.

913
00:48:54.529 --> 00:48:56.827
Aah!<br/>Okay, I will.

914
00:49:03.672 --> 00:49:05.697
You threw her down the stairs?

915
00:49:07.676 --> 00:49:09.268
No.

916
00:49:09.344 --> 00:49:12.438
But I imagined it.

917
00:49:12.514 --> 00:49:15.278
And I liked it.

918
00:49:15.350 --> 00:49:16.442
I'm evil.

919
00:49:16.518 --> 00:49:19.612
I'm a horrible, horrible person.

920
00:49:19.688 --> 00:49:21.747
Thank you.

921
00:49:21.823 --> 00:49:24.348
Come on, she's practically<br/>ruined our lives.

922
00:49:24.426 --> 00:49:26.451
It's natural to have thoughts<br/>like that.

923
00:49:26.528 --> 00:49:29.463
- Really?<br/>- Yeah.

924
00:49:29.531 --> 00:49:32.432
I mean, I've even had a couple.

925
00:49:33.535 --> 00:49:34.797
Aaaah!

926
00:49:37.072 --> 00:49:38.972
NANCY:<br/>Like what?

927
00:49:39.040 --> 00:49:41.304
Just, you know,<br/>snapping her neck

928
00:49:41.376 --> 00:49:43.936
or electrocuting her.

929
00:49:45.380 --> 00:49:47.109
You know,<br/>just beating her to death,

930
00:49:47.182 --> 00:49:49.309
decapitating her,

931
00:49:49.384 --> 00:49:51.909
drowning her, just,<br/>you know, bludgeoning her,

932
00:49:51.986 --> 00:49:55.444
in a humane way, but...

933
00:49:55.523 --> 00:49:59.254
Dicing her up<br/>into little, little pieces.

934
00:49:59.327 --> 00:50:03.491
But asphyxiating her first<br/>so she didn't feel anything.

935
00:50:03.565 --> 00:50:05.556
I'm glad you clarified that.

936
00:50:05.633 --> 00:50:08.227
You're evil, too.

937
00:50:08.303 --> 00:50:11.431
I'm finished.<br/>That's what I am.

938
00:50:11.506 --> 00:50:13.133
And it was incredible.

939
00:50:13.208 --> 00:50:15.176
The last 60 pages<br/>just poured out of me.

940
00:50:15.243 --> 00:50:18.337
Let's open that really great<br/>champagne and celebrate.

941
00:50:18.413 --> 00:50:19.505
CONNELLY:<br/>Alex?!

942
00:50:19.581 --> 00:50:22.175
Alex?!<br/>Nancy?!

943
00:50:22.250 --> 00:50:23.808
[Panting]

944
00:50:23.885 --> 00:50:26.115
Ooh!<br/>Come quick.

945
00:50:26.187 --> 00:50:29.850
A huge rat just ran<br/>under me cupboard.

946
00:50:29.924 --> 00:50:31.858
Oh, come.<br/>Come on, quick.

947
00:50:31.926 --> 00:50:32.858
Quick, Alex!

948
00:50:32.927 --> 00:50:35.259
- I'll pop the cork.<br/>- I'll be right back.

949
00:50:35.330 --> 00:50:37.855
Are you sure it was a rat,<br/>Mrs. Connelly?

950
00:50:37.932 --> 00:50:39.627
I saw its face.

951
00:50:39.701 --> 00:50:41.794
You saw its face?

952
00:50:41.870 --> 00:50:46.933
All right, let's see if we can't<br/>find this big, bad rat.

953
00:50:47.008 --> 00:50:49.306
You sure it might not<br/>have been a dust bunny?

954
00:50:49.377 --> 00:50:51.504
'Cause sometimes<br/>they look rodent-like.

955
00:50:51.579 --> 00:50:53.877
Aah!<br/>The rat!

956
00:50:53.948 --> 00:50:55.609
- Where?<br/>- There!

957
00:50:55.683 --> 00:50:57.412
Oh.<br/>Oh, that's not a rat.

958
00:50:57.485 --> 00:50:59.953
That's like<br/>a little field mouse.

959
00:51:02.257 --> 00:51:05.488
Alan!<br/>Your purse fell into the fire.

960
00:51:05.560 --> 00:51:06.492
Oh, no.

961
00:51:06.561 --> 00:51:08.552
Alan!

962
00:51:09.998 --> 00:51:11.488
Oh, don't!<br/>Oh, don't!

963
00:51:11.566 --> 00:51:13.124
My book!

964
00:51:13.201 --> 00:51:15.101
Ow!

965
00:51:15.170 --> 00:51:16.501
Oh, Alan!

966
00:51:16.571 --> 00:51:18.937
Oh!<br/>Oh!

967
00:51:20.208 --> 00:51:22.267
You'll burn yourself!

968
00:51:22.343 --> 00:51:24.436
Door!<br/>Nancy, door!

969
00:51:24.512 --> 00:51:26.878
Get the door!<br/>Nancy, door!

970
00:51:26.948 --> 00:51:28.142
Is that your book?

971
00:51:28.216 --> 00:51:29.649
Okay.<br/>Oh!

972
00:51:29.717 --> 00:51:32.117
- Door!<br/>- Okay! Oh, my God!

973
00:51:37.192 --> 00:51:38.420
Oh!

974
00:51:40.261 --> 00:51:41.990
No!<br/>No!

975
00:51:42.063 --> 00:51:44.031
- No! No! No!<br/>- Alex!

976
00:51:44.098 --> 00:51:47.033
Stop!<br/>No, stop!

977
00:51:54.943 --> 00:51:57.036
Aah!<br/>No!

978
00:51:57.111 --> 00:51:59.136
No!

979
00:52:08.389 --> 00:52:11.586
I swear she did that on purpose.

980
00:52:27.175 --> 00:52:29.837
MAN ON TELEVISION: And now<br/>here's tonight's Health Watch.

981
00:52:29.911 --> 00:52:32.345
WOMAN ON TELEVISION: A deadly<br/>virus has hit New York City.

982
00:52:32.413 --> 00:52:34.643
Doctors warn that this<br/>particular strain

983
00:52:34.716 --> 00:52:37.014
is extremely dangerous<br/>in children under 5

984
00:52:37.085 --> 00:52:39.178
and especially to the elderly.

985
00:52:39.254 --> 00:52:40.383
Symptoms include high fever,

986
00:52:40.418 --> 00:52:41.512
Symptoms include high fever,

987
00:52:41.589 --> 00:52:44.615
accompanied by nausea<br/>and violent diarrhea.

988
00:52:46.427 --> 00:52:48.691
Mr. Rose?

989
00:52:48.763 --> 00:52:51.527
Would you sprinkle some salt<br/>on the steps?

990
00:52:51.599 --> 00:52:53.032
They're terribly icy.

991
00:52:53.101 --> 00:52:55.569
You better not go outside then.

992
00:52:57.605 --> 00:53:00.335
Ow!<br/>Ow!

993
00:53:02.377 --> 00:53:04.208
Mother...

994
00:53:06.548 --> 00:53:09.449
A giant tow truck<br/>runs it over,

995
00:53:09.517 --> 00:53:12.953
followed by an S.U.V.<br/>that it was dragging.

996
00:53:13.021 --> 00:53:14.648
Alex, that's horrible.

997
00:53:14.722 --> 00:53:17.714
I know.<br/>I know.

998
00:53:17.792 --> 00:53:19.657
Can you believe it?

999
00:53:19.727 --> 00:53:22.127
No, I can't.

1000
00:53:22.196 --> 00:53:23.754
I tried to warn you, Alex.

1001
00:53:23.831 --> 00:53:27.961
We're canceling every contract<br/>that's in breach.

1002
00:53:28.036 --> 00:53:31.836
In breach?<br/>I have the crushed PowerBook.

1003
00:53:31.906 --> 00:53:34.033
I'm sorry, darling.

1004
00:53:34.108 --> 00:53:35.905
If you put as much energy<br/>into your work

1005
00:53:35.977 --> 00:53:37.342
as you do into excuses,

1006
00:53:37.412 --> 00:53:39.175
you might have made<br/>the deadline.

1007
00:53:39.247 --> 00:53:41.340
- Do you have the shark?<br/>- MAN: Yes, we do.

1008
00:53:41.416 --> 00:53:44.908
Excellent.<br/>I'm gonna have that, no bones.

1009
00:53:48.256 --> 00:53:49.587
[Man coughing]

1010
00:53:53.161 --> 00:53:54.753
[Sniffling]

1011
00:54:00.268 --> 00:54:02.793
[Coughing]

1012
00:54:20.855 --> 00:54:22.345
Hi.

1013
00:54:39.507 --> 00:54:41.839
How do you feel?

1014
00:54:41.909 --> 00:54:44.969
Like I'm knocking<br/>on death's door.

1015
00:54:52.787 --> 00:54:54.812
Well, look who's here.

1016
00:54:54.889 --> 00:54:57.449
Come in, both of you.

1017
00:54:58.726 --> 00:55:00.159
Hi, Mrs. Connelly.

1018
00:55:00.228 --> 00:55:01.695
Happy Thanksgiving.

1019
00:55:01.763 --> 00:55:02.695
Oh, thank you.

1020
00:55:02.764 --> 00:55:06.200
- How are you?<br/>- Oh, I'm grand.

1021
00:55:06.267 --> 00:55:07.666
But how are the two of you?

1022
00:55:07.735 --> 00:55:10.761
You look rather sallow.

1023
00:55:10.838 --> 00:55:12.897
No, no.<br/>We're fine.

1024
00:55:12.974 --> 00:55:14.601
We brought you some popcorn.

1025
00:55:14.676 --> 00:55:17.372
Oh.<br/>Oh, how lovely.

1026
00:55:17.445 --> 00:55:21.677
I adore popcorn.<br/>So does Little Dick.

1027
00:55:21.749 --> 00:55:25.150
So, did you have a nice<br/>Thanksgiving dinner?

1028
00:55:25.219 --> 00:55:27.119
Oh, yes, dear.

1029
00:55:27.188 --> 00:55:30.646
That lovely Italian lady<br/>in the post office

1030
00:55:30.725 --> 00:55:32.386
brought me a sumptuous dinner.

1031
00:55:32.460 --> 00:55:34.655
The only problem is<br/>some of the carcass

1032
00:55:34.729 --> 00:55:38.256
didn't go down the disposal.

1033
00:55:38.332 --> 00:55:42.029
That's 'cause you don't have<br/>a disposal.

1034
00:55:42.103 --> 00:55:43.730
I don't?

1035
00:55:56.350 --> 00:55:58.818
It's really stuffed up.

1036
00:56:10.998 --> 00:56:11.987
[Gags]

1037
00:56:13.134 --> 00:56:15.068
[Coughing]

1038
00:56:16.170 --> 00:56:18.070
All right!

1039
00:56:24.712 --> 00:56:28.079
If you ask me, you two have got<br/>some sort of bug.

1040
00:56:28.149 --> 00:56:29.309

1041

[Groans]

1042
00:56:31.319 --> 00:56:35.847
Thank God Officer Dan took me<br/>to have a flu shot last week.

1043
00:56:35.923 --> 00:56:38.983
Upchuck is a delicacy<br/>for Little Dick.

1044
00:56:39.060 --> 00:56:40.324
He's salivating.

1045
00:56:40.359 --> 00:56:41.588
He's salivating.

1046
00:56:43.498 --> 00:56:45.056
How much can we get, Kenneth?

1047
00:56:45.133 --> 00:56:48.102
That depends on how far you're<br/>willing to drop the price.

1048

you've gotta buy me<br/>a drink first.

1389
01:17:40.820 --> 01:17:42.617
Is that smoke?!

1390
01:17:44.991 --> 01:17:48.449
Get off me, you crazy bitch!

1391
01:18:08.782 --> 01:18:11.478
[Squawking]

1392
01:18:43.483 --> 01:18:45.713
[Coughing]<br/>Wait, wait.

1393
01:18:45.785 --> 01:18:48.117
What?<br/>What?

1394
01:18:52.325 --> 01:18:54.953
Here we go.<br/>You all right?

1395
01:18:55.028 --> 01:18:57.087
Yeah.<br/>Where's Little Dickey?

1396
01:18:57.163 --> 01:18:58.790
Dickey, Dickey.<br/>Here you go.

1397
01:18:58.865 --> 01:19:00.594
Here, here.

1398
01:19:00.667 --> 01:19:01.793
Oh, Dick.

1399
01:19:01.868 --> 01:19:03.802
[Siren wailing]

1400
01:19:03.870 --> 01:19:04.928
Dickey.

1401
01:19:05.004 --> 01:19:06.835
Hello.

1402
01:19:08.174 --> 01:19:10.005
Never thought you had it in you.

1403
01:19:10.076 --> 01:19:13.045
Thank God I bought<br/>that fire extinguisher.

1404
01:19:13.113 --> 01:19:15.172
We were just<br/>trying to help her out.

1405
01:19:15.248 --> 01:19:16.715
Her and Little Dickey.

1406
01:19:16.783 --> 01:19:19.149
I'll just write this citation up<br/>for electricity.

1407
01:19:19.219 --> 01:19:20.314
Thank you.<br/>Thanks.

1408
01:19:20.349 --> 01:19:21.409
Thank you.<br/>Thanks.

1409
01:19:31.998 --> 01:19:34.728
KENNETH: Believe it or not,<br/>I need two more autographs,

1410
01:19:34.801 --> 01:19:36.666
and that will be it.

1411
01:19:36.736 --> 01:19:39.068
- So how's the new place?<br/>- It's cute.

1412
01:19:39.139 --> 01:19:42.472
I'll tell you, the Bronx<br/>is an up-and-coming borough.

1413
01:19:42.542 --> 01:19:45.340
You didn't lie, Kenneth.<br/>It all looks incredible.

1414
01:19:45.411 --> 01:19:48.107
I told you they'd fix it up,<br/>didn't I?

1415
01:19:48.181 --> 01:19:50.240
Friedmans, meet Alex and Nancy.

1416
01:19:50.316 --> 01:19:51.248
- Hi.<br/>- Hey.

1417
01:19:51.317 --> 01:19:52.875
We can't thank you enough.

1418
01:19:52.952 --> 01:19:56.251
This is just a dream house.<br/>It's so quiet.

1419
01:19:56.322 --> 01:19:58.449
Honey, won't this be perfect<br/>for your sleep disorder?

1420
01:19:58.525 --> 01:20:00.186
I'm drowsy already.

1421
01:20:00.260 --> 01:20:02.057
Hey, who wants to run upstairs<br/>and say hello?

1422
01:20:02.128 --> 01:20:03.755
Well, we should get going.

1423
01:20:03.830 --> 01:20:05.991
We should.<br/>We have to...

1424
01:20:06.065 --> 01:20:06.690
Yeah.

1425
01:20:06.766 --> 01:20:08.358
Nonsense!

1426
01:20:08.434 --> 01:20:10.595
You pulled the woman<br/>out of a burning building.

1427
01:20:10.670 --> 01:20:13.366
You'd break her heart<br/>if you didn't say goodbye.

1428
01:20:13.439 --> 01:20:14.963
Come on!

1429
01:20:15.041 --> 01:20:18.238
Mrs. Connelly,<br/>I brought you a surprise!

1430
01:20:18.311 --> 01:20:21.508
Mrs. Connelly!!

1431
01:20:21.581 --> 01:20:23.446
The hearing on this one.

1432
01:20:23.516 --> 01:20:26.815
Look who's here.<br/>She's asleep.

1433
01:20:26.886 --> 01:20:28.513
Sweetheart.

1434
01:20:31.925 --> 01:20:34.086
She's stiff as a board.

1435
01:20:34.160 --> 01:20:37.755
No.<br/>She's just hard-of-hearing.

1436
01:20:38.631 --> 01:20:40.622
Mrs. Connelly!

1437
01:20:40.700 --> 01:20:43.066
["Hawaii Five-O" theme plays]

1438
01:20:47.640 --> 01:20:49.631
She's dead.

1439
01:20:49.709 --> 01:20:52.075
Oh, poor thing.

1440
01:20:52.145 --> 01:20:53.942
No.

1441
01:20:54.013 --> 01:20:55.913
She can't be dead.

1442
01:20:55.982 --> 01:20:58.644
I guess it was just her time.

1443
01:21:00.053 --> 01:21:02.715
Come on, I'll call<br/>the Friedmans.

1444
01:21:02.789 --> 01:21:05.053
You don't have to stay here<br/>for this.

1445
01:21:05.124 --> 01:21:07.422
Come.<br/>Come, come, come.

1446
01:21:10.396 --> 01:21:12.921
Must have been<br/>all the excitement.

1447
01:21:34.754 --> 01:21:36.847
I can't believe it.

1448
01:21:36.923 --> 01:21:39.687
She was so full of life.

1449
01:21:40.827 --> 01:21:44.319
I mean, for all our differences,

1450
01:21:44.397 --> 01:21:48.629
that old lady really had<br/>a lot of spunk.

1451
01:21:48.701 --> 01:21:50.828
A lot of it.

1452
01:21:51.904 --> 01:21:54.464
Do you think she's up in heaven?

1453
01:21:56.142 --> 01:21:57.575
Well, I'll tell you something.

1454
01:21:57.644 --> 01:22:01.910
Wherever she is,<br/>she's in a better place.

1455
01:22:09.522 --> 01:22:13.549
You should have seen their faces<br/>when I said she was a goner.

1456
01:22:13.626 --> 01:22:16.561
So cheap, though I wish<br/>I could have been there.

1457
01:22:16.629 --> 01:22:17.391
Trust me.

1458
01:22:17.463 --> 01:22:20.830
It wasn't easy holding<br/>me breath all that long.

1459
01:22:20.900 --> 01:22:24.358
Next time, I want a bigger cut<br/>of your commission, Kenny.

1460
01:22:24.437 --> 01:22:26.997
What are you talking about?<br/>We give you everything, Ma.

1461
01:22:27.073 --> 01:22:28.404
There's barely enough left

1462
01:22:28.474 --> 01:22:31.875
for Danny and I to have<br/>a cruise to the Caribbean.

1463
01:22:31.944 --> 01:22:35.209
I'm the one putting<br/>me caboose on the line.

1464
01:22:35.281 --> 01:22:35.872
Oh, come on.

1465
01:22:35.948 --> 01:22:37.711
You had it easy<br/>with Alex and Nancy.

1466
01:22:37.784 --> 01:22:41.720
They were a nice couple.<br/>I do hope they'll be all right.

1467
01:22:41.788 --> 01:22:43.016
Ah, they'll be fine.

1468
01:22:43.089 --> 01:22:45.557
He's a writer.<br/>They thrive on adversity.

1469
01:22:45.625 --> 01:22:49.493
I hope his next book is better<br/>than his last one.

1470
01:22:49.562 --> 01:22:53.658
Maybe this time he'll write<br/>about something he knows.

1471
