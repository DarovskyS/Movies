00:00:30,840 --> 00:00:31,960
Where are we going?

00:00:32,560 --> 00:00:34,320
[woman]
Come on, Angela. [blows]

5
00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:37,280
But who'll mind the sheep?

[indistinct chatter]

11
00:00:54,560 --> 00:00:56,560
Dada, do you want to hear my song?

12
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,040
[humming]

13
00:01:05,240 --> 00:01:06,320
Goodbye, Angela.

14
00:01:08,480 --> 00:01:09,320
Dada.

15
00:01:10,720 --> 00:01:12,840
[blaring]

16
00:01:17,560 --> 00:01:19,200
[woman]
Say goodbye to your Dada.

[music swelling]

18
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:23,960
-Safe journey!
-Goodbye!

19
00:01:24,040 --> 00:01:24,960
Bye, Dada!

20
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:26,680
Safe journey!

who art in heaven, hallowed be thy name…

[whispering]

25
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:51,640
[Angela] And-- And--

26
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:53,440
Ugh…

27
00:01:53,960 --> 00:01:56,000
There's something else, Baby Jesus.

28
00:01:56,880 --> 00:01:59,800
Oh, Mr. McGinty is having a baby cow!

29
00:01:59,880 --> 00:02:02,600
Well, Mr. McGinty isn't having a baby cow.

30
00:02:02,680 --> 00:02:06,520
His cow is having a baby cow.
Mam says he's a little bit worried,

31
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:09,960
as he can't be affording to get
a cow doctor with Christmas and all.

32
00:02:10,760 --> 00:02:13,600
Maybe you could have
a word with Himself upstairs

33
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:15,520
to make sure everything's okay.

34
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,040
You would?

35
00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:19,720
Thank you, Baby Jesus.

36
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:22,640
Do you want to hear my big news?

37
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:27,560
Mam is getting me a big Christmas

38
00:02:27,640 --> 00:02:29,240
[loudly]
surprise!

39
00:02:30,040 --> 00:02:31,040
Angela!

40
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:32,600
Sorry.

41
00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:36,040
Now, between me and you,

42
00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:38,400
I reckon it could be the doll

43
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:40,160
[loudly]
from Hartigan's Toy Shop!

44
00:02:40,240 --> 00:02:41,280
[Mam] Angela!

45
00:02:43,480 --> 00:02:44,320
[sighs]

46
00:02:46,440 --> 00:02:49,520
Oh, she's the most beautiful doll,
Baby Jesus.

47
00:02:50,200 --> 00:02:53,880
Golden hair,
eyes as green as the Shannon.

48
00:02:53,960 --> 00:02:55,880
[gasps]
And she's as cute as you.

49
00:02:56,760 --> 00:02:57,600
Angela.

50
00:02:58,480 --> 00:02:59,560
Look at your hair.

51
00:02:59,640 --> 00:03:02,680
It's a knot of tangles.
You're washing it today.

52
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:07,000
Mam has been
in a woeful odd mood the last few days.

53
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:09,080
All cleaning and scrubbing and fussing.

54
00:03:09,160 --> 00:03:10,520
[Mam]
Come on, will ye?

55
00:03:10,600 --> 00:03:12,920
-Hush!
-See you later, Baby Jesus.

56
00:03:13,480 --> 00:03:15,600
Goodbye, Joseph! Goodbye, Mary!

57
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:17,560
Goodbye, sheep! Goodbye, donkey!

58
00:03:19,640 --> 00:03:20,480
Washed.

59
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:24,160
[gentle choral music playing]

60
00:03:26,600 --> 00:03:28,040

[gentle music soaring]

62
00:03:37,480 --> 00:03:39,080
Doll! Doll! Doll! Doll! Doll!

63
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:42,600
[gasps]

64
00:03:44,160 --> 00:03:47,160
[sweet, delicate music playing]

65
00:03:52,600 --> 00:03:53,560
Yeah, very nice.

66
00:03:55,640 --> 00:03:58,000
Maybe Mam will get you some mittens.

67
00:04:10,240 --> 00:04:13,160
Go on in. I just need to
have a quick word with Mrs. Blake.

68
00:04:14,320 --> 00:04:15,240
[knocking]

69
00:04:18,040 --> 00:04:19,600
[Mrs. Blake]
Oh, 'tis yourself!

70
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:21,520
I heard about the big surprise.

71
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:24,040
[gasps]
The big Christmas surprise!

72
00:04:24,520 --> 00:04:27,200
[whispering] I'd be so grateful.
She'll be so excited.

73
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:29,160
She's going to be over the moon!

74
00:04:29,240 --> 00:04:30,560
-[gasps]
-[gasps]

75
00:04:31,080 --> 00:04:32,760
Quick!
Pretend we're playing a game.

76
00:04:32,840 --> 00:04:36,160
-Well, if the princess demands it.
-[giggles]

77
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:38,480
Don't listen to that fool.

78
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:42,760
[Mam] Was that a nosy little pigtail I saw
swishing back away inside the house?

79
00:04:42,840 --> 00:04:43,680
No.

80
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:45,160
No?

81
00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:47,160
Uh, maybe?

82
00:04:47,880 --> 00:04:51,240
-Why am I always the fool?
-Who do you want to be, Pat?

83
00:04:51,320 --> 00:04:54,320
-Not the princess.
-Little Aggie could be the princess.

84
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:57,320
"Hello! I am Aggie, the princess!"

85
00:04:57,400 --> 00:04:58,440
[blows raspberry]

86
00:04:58,520 --> 00:04:59,520
-[squeals]
-[laughs]

87
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:02,440
-Get away from the princess!
-Mother of Mary of Joseph.

88
00:05:02,520 --> 00:05:04,760
I can't hear myself think.

89
00:05:04,840 --> 00:05:08,840
My queen! The princess demands a story!

90
00:05:08,920 --> 00:05:10,280
[sighs]

91
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:14,040
Go and tidy your room.

92
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:15,960
Go on.

93
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:18,640
Come on. The queen's in a bad mood.

94
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:19,800
[sighs]

95
00:05:19,880 --> 00:05:21,440
-Again.
-Pat!

96
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:23,320
It's Christmas Eve.

97
00:05:23,400 --> 00:05:25,320
You'll all be getting something nice.

98
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:27,600
Now, go on. Clean your room.

99
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:28,520
[sighs]

100
00:05:29,240 --> 00:05:31,000
Clean. Clean. Clean.

101
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:36,040
[delicate piano music playing]

102
00:05:36,120 --> 00:05:37,480
[Mam sighs]

103
00:05:37,560 --> 00:05:38,480
Wait.

104
00:05:40,200 --> 00:05:42,400
There's always time for a story.

105
00:05:43,040 --> 00:05:44,360
[Mam]
Come on. Sit.

106
00:05:44,440 --> 00:05:46,320
-[laughing]
-Story!

107
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:49,240
Ready?

108
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:51,680
Once upon a time,

109
00:05:51,760 --> 00:05:54,360
in a faraway land--

110
00:05:54,440 --> 00:05:56,120
Australia?

111
00:05:57,400 --> 00:06:00,360
Once upon a time, in Australia,

112
00:06:00,440 --> 00:06:03,840
there was a big, fat king
and a skinny, little pauper.

113
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:08,160
One day, the king
and the pauper bumped into a magic genie.

114
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:15,000
Well, the genie was in a fantastic mood,
so he offered them both one wish each.

115
00:06:15,080 --> 00:06:16,320
One wish each?

116
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:18,040
[Mam]
The king loudly shouted,

117
00:06:18,120 --> 00:06:22,720
[in a deep voice] "I wish, I wish,
I wish for all the gold in the world!"

118
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:23,840
[all laugh]

119
00:06:24,640 --> 00:06:27,320
Now it was the pauper's turn
to make his wish.

120
00:06:27,960 --> 00:06:30,600
The pauper walked into a corner

121
00:06:30,680 --> 00:06:33,240
and turned away
from the king and the genie.

122
00:06:33,320 --> 00:06:34,760
He shut his eyes.

123
00:06:35,720 --> 00:06:39,040
"I wish, I wish…

124
00:06:39,640 --> 00:06:41,320
I wish."

125
00:06:42,920 --> 00:06:44,720
What did the pauper wish for?

126
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:45,640
[soft chuckle]

127
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:50,280
Years later,
the king and pauper met again.

128
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:54,360
Well, wasn't the king
now driven demented with the gold?

129
00:06:54,440 --> 00:06:56,680
It was in his socks,

130
00:06:56,760 --> 00:06:57,680
his boots,

131
00:06:57,760 --> 00:06:59,120
under his pillow.

132
00:06:59,200 --> 00:07:00,600
But the pauper,

133
00:07:00,680 --> 00:07:05,120
well, the pauper was just
the happiest man alive.

134
00:07:05,760 --> 00:07:07,560
The king was desperate to know

135
00:07:07,640 --> 00:07:10,960
what in the name of God
did the pauper wish for?

136
00:07:11,960 --> 00:07:14,120
The king pleaded and pleaded,

137
00:07:14,200 --> 00:07:15,240
"Tell me your wish.

138
00:07:15,320 --> 00:07:16,600
Tell me your wish.

139
00:07:16,680 --> 00:07:18,240
Tell me your wish."

140
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:21,000
The pauper smiled.

141
00:07:21,080 --> 00:07:24,160
"All right," says he, "Hm. I'll tell you."

142
00:07:25,240 --> 00:07:26,600
"I wished,

143
00:07:26,680 --> 00:07:28,200
I wished,

144
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:31,120
I wished…"

145
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:34,920
What did he wish for?

146
00:07:35,640 --> 00:07:37,360
Clean your room and I'll tell you.

147
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:38,800
[all kids]
Mam!

148
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:40,360
[all laugh]

149
00:07:40,440 --> 00:07:42,160
Come on. Go, go, go.

150
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:44,080
We have to get this house shipshape.

151
00:07:47,200 --> 00:07:49,720
[sighs]
He was the happiest man alive.

152
00:07:50,440 --> 00:07:52,640
Maybe he wished for…
Maybe it was--

153
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:55,120
Tom?
Do you think Mam's all right?

154
00:07:55,840 --> 00:07:57,520
She's been acting funny for days,

155
00:07:57,600 --> 00:07:58,960
all rushing and fussing.

156
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:01,320
It's the same every year.

157
00:08:01,400 --> 00:08:02,920
Mam misses Da.

158
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,560
Christmas, New Year, your birthday.

159
00:08:05,640 --> 00:08:08,480
With Da away working, it's hard on her.

160
00:08:12,760 --> 00:08:14,600
[squeaking]

161
00:08:17,960 --> 00:08:18,960
[clattering]

162
00:08:24,280 --> 00:08:25,280
[door opens]

163
00:08:34,280 --> 00:08:35,640
You go first.

164
00:08:36,160 --> 00:08:37,000
[coos]

165
00:08:37,080 --> 00:08:38,520
[delicate music plays]

166
00:08:38,600 --> 00:08:40,440
[Angela]
I miss singing him my song.

167
00:08:42,520 --> 00:08:44,680
Your turn. What do you miss?

168
00:08:45,280 --> 00:08:47,480
-The way he smelled like horses.
-[giggles]

169
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:50,720
-[laughs]
-Horses?

170
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:53,240
No, like the saddles do.

171
00:08:53,320 --> 00:08:56,400
Warm and, uh… and leathery.

172
00:08:56,480 --> 00:08:57,520
[coos]

173
00:08:57,600 --> 00:08:58,600
What do you miss?

174
00:08:59,480 --> 00:09:00,320
His laugh.

175
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:03,600
[chuckles]
The one he had when he played with us.

176
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:04,640
And Mam?

177
00:09:05,400 --> 00:09:07,400
What-- What do you think Mam misses?

178
00:09:08,400 --> 00:09:10,600
[sighs]
She told me once she missed--

179
00:09:10,680 --> 00:09:12,280
[gasps]
Aggie's eating Da!

180
00:09:12,360 --> 00:09:13,680
Oh, careful, Aggie.

181
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:16,080
And do you miss Dada?

182
00:09:16,160 --> 00:09:17,240
Man.

183
00:09:17,320 --> 00:09:18,280
Dada.

184
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:19,640

Where are you going?

549
00:27:27,760 --> 00:27:29,120
We will get him home, Pat.

[Dorothy]
I can help.

551
00:27:32,200 --> 00:27:34,080
I can help get your father home.

Help?

553
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:37,320
Father was right.

554
00:27:37,400 --> 00:27:39,440
You can't take the train to Australia,

555
00:27:39,520 --> 00:27:41,200
but I do know another way.

556
00:27:43,480 --> 00:27:46,280
So, the king pleas, "Tell me your wish!"

"Tell me your wish!

558
00:27:47,680 --> 00:27:49,160

"I wished… I wished… I wished…"

562
00:27:58,440 --> 00:27:59,680
What did he wish for?

Did your father not have to work?

571
00:28:18,720 --> 00:28:20,920
Mam says he worked at the milk mart.

572
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:24,240
-But they didn't need him anymore.
-Is that why he went away?

573
00:28:25,320 --> 00:28:26,160
Yeah.

574
00:28:26,720 --> 00:28:28,600
Then let's go get him home.

575
00:28:31,040 --> 00:28:32,840
Three tickets to Australia, please.

576
00:28:36,320 --> 00:28:37,160
