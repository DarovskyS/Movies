00:37:29,074 --> 00:37:32,537
Y-- y-- yes, Miss Trunchbull?

693
00:37:33,120 --> 00:37:38,918
What have I said about… pigtails?

694
00:37:39,501 --> 00:37:42,004
I hate pigtails.

695
00:37:42,087 --> 00:37:44,589
But my mummy likes them.
She says they make me look pretty.

696
00:37:44,674 --> 00:37:47,051
Well, your mother is a twit!

697
00:37:47,134 --> 00:37:48,886
[sports announcer faintly over PA]
And here she goes!

698
00:37:48,969 --> 00:37:52,014
-Look at that spin!
-[Agatha grunting]

699
00:37:52,097 --> 00:37:53,598
[announcer] Oh, my word!

700
00:37:53,682 --> 00:37:54,934
[children gasping]

701
00:37:55,017 --> 00:37:57,352
[announcer] That's far! That's very…

702
00:37:58,687 --> 00:37:59,938
…and we're there!

703
00:38:00,522 --> 00:38:02,232
[Agatha] Yes! Still got it.

704
00:38:02,982 --> 00:38:06,236
Check and see if that child
is still alive, will you?

705
00:38:08,322 --> 00:38:09,989
[clears throat]

706
00:38:11,366 --> 00:38:13,159
And what is your name?

707
00:38:13,242 --> 00:38:14,077
Matilda.

708
00:38:14,869 --> 00:38:15,954
Matilda Wormwood.

709
00:38:16,037 --> 00:38:20,124
Oh! You're Wormwood, are you?

710
00:38:21,334 --> 00:38:24,253
I like troublemakers, Wormwood.

711
00:38:25,129 --> 00:38:27,215
They make such a lovely sound…

712
00:38:27,799 --> 00:38:30,051
when they snap.

713
00:38:30,759 --> 00:38:32,178
[boy] She's alive!

714
00:38:32,803 --> 00:38:34,930
-[boy 2] Hip, hip!
-[children] Hooray!

715
00:38:35,014 --> 00:38:37,016
-Hip, hip!
-Hooray!

716
00:38:37,100 --> 00:38:39,477
-Hip, hip!
-Hooray!

717
00:38:39,560 --> 00:38:41,312
[all cheering]

718
00:38:42,563 --> 00:38:45,649
[Agatha over PA] Remember, Wormwood,
you can never win.

719
00:38:45,733 --> 00:38:50,070
I promise you that.
And a promise is a promise is a promise.

720
00:38:52,990 --> 00:38:55,534
[Matilda] And so the great day arrived.

721
00:38:55,618 --> 00:38:59,079
The Burning Woman Hurling Through the Air

722
00:38:59,162 --> 00:39:01,581
With Dynamite in Her Hair

723
00:39:01,665 --> 00:39:04,960
Over Sharks and Spiky Objects

724
00:39:05,043 --> 00:39:07,670
Caught by the Man Locked in the Cage.

725
00:39:09,047 --> 00:39:13,426
It was like the entire world
had gathered to see the acrobat

726
00:39:13,510 --> 00:39:18,390
and the escapologist's incredible
death-defying feat.

727
00:39:19,266 --> 00:39:21,393
[plane flying overhead]

728
00:39:21,476 --> 00:39:24,061
[crowd murmuring, chattering indistinctly]

729
00:39:29,776 --> 00:39:30,777
[laughing]

730
00:39:30,860 --> 00:39:33,655
[band playing upbeat music]

731
00:39:47,418 --> 00:39:49,003
[women laughing]

732
00:39:52,089 --> 00:39:54,383
Everything was arranged by…

733
00:39:55,467 --> 00:39:57,928
the acrobat's evil stepsister.

734
00:39:58,512 --> 00:40:02,098
A frightening woman who used to be
an Olympic class hammer thrower.

735
00:40:02,683 --> 00:40:05,894
People whispered that in her dark
and brooding heart,

736
00:40:05,977 --> 00:40:09,606
she resented her stepsister's
success and love.

737
00:40:11,024 --> 00:40:12,400
[cymbal crashes]

738
00:40:12,484 --> 00:40:13,819
Suddenly…

739
00:40:14,736 --> 00:40:16,613
out came the escapologist,

740
00:40:16,697 --> 00:40:18,990
but there was no sign of the acrobat,

741
00:40:19,074 --> 00:40:22,702
and no glimpse at all
of the shiny white scarf she always wore.

742
00:40:23,995 --> 00:40:25,914
Ladies and gentlemen,

743
00:40:26,497 --> 00:40:28,291
boys and girls,

744
00:40:28,374 --> 00:40:31,962
The Burning Woman Hurling Through the Air

745
00:40:32,045 --> 00:40:34,672
With Dynamite in Her Hair

746
00:40:34,755 --> 00:40:37,092
Over Sharks and Spiky Objects

747
00:40:37,175 --> 00:40:39,427
Caught by the Man Locked in the Cage

748
00:40:39,510 --> 00:40:42,555
has been canceled!

749
00:40:42,638 --> 00:40:44,765
[all groaning]

750
00:40:45,558 --> 00:40:48,894
Canceled because my wife is…

751
00:40:49,645 --> 00:40:50,771
pregnant!

752
00:40:51,355 --> 00:40:53,357
-[all gasping]
-Oh, Matilda.

753
00:40:54,984 --> 00:40:58,112
[Matilda] Absolute… silence.

754
00:41:00,405 --> 00:41:03,075
You could have heard a fly burp.

755
00:41:05,660 --> 00:41:07,537
-Then suddenly, the audience…
-[child] Hip, hip!

756
00:41:07,621 --> 00:41:10,874
…jumped to its feet
and roared in appreciation!

757
00:41:10,958 --> 00:41:13,627
[band playing fanfare]

758
00:41:15,212 --> 00:41:16,338
[yapping]

759
00:41:16,421 --> 00:41:18,965
-The great feat was instantly forgotten.
-[laughing]

760
00:41:19,841 --> 00:41:22,344
And the applause went on for over an hour!

761
00:41:25,764 --> 00:41:28,475
Oh, Matilda, that's wonderful!

762
00:41:28,558 --> 00:41:30,685
I love stories that end happily.

763
00:41:31,770 --> 00:41:36,565
Forgotten by everyone
except the acrobat's evil stepsister.

764
00:41:37,942 --> 00:41:42,363
When all had quietened down
she produced a contract!

765
00:41:42,446 --> 00:41:44,240
-[Mrs. Phelps] A contract?
-[feedback squealing]

766
00:41:44,323 --> 00:41:47,451
[over PA] A contract you have signed
to perform this feat.

767
00:41:47,535 --> 00:41:50,454
-And perform this feat, you shall!
-No.

768
00:41:50,538 --> 00:41:53,666
[Matilda and Agatha]
I've paid for the posters, publicity,

769
00:41:53,749 --> 00:41:56,169
the catering, the toilet facilities.

770
00:41:56,252 --> 00:41:58,171
If I give the crowd their money back,

771
00:41:58,254 --> 00:41:59,755
where is my profit?

772
00:42:00,339 --> 00:42:03,216
A contract is a contract is a contract.

773
00:42:03,300 --> 00:42:04,885
My hands are tied.

774
00:42:04,968 --> 00:42:08,180
The Burning Woman Hurling Through the Air

775
00:42:08,263 --> 00:42:10,140
With Dynamite in Her Hair

776
00:42:10,223 --> 00:42:12,893
Over Sharks and Spiky Objects

777
00:42:12,976 --> 00:42:16,188
Caught by The Man Locked in a Cage
will be performed,

778
00:42:16,271 --> 00:42:18,899
and it will be performed this day!

779
00:42:18,982 --> 00:42:21,568
Or off to prison you both shall go!

780
00:42:25,948 --> 00:42:27,865
What… what happened next?

781
00:42:29,576 --> 00:42:30,743
I dunno.

782
00:42:30,827 --> 00:42:32,787
What? How can you not know?

783
00:42:33,496 --> 00:42:36,583
It just comes to me in… fizzes.

784
00:42:36,666 --> 00:42:39,836
Well, could you fizz up
a little bit more for me? Now.

785
00:42:40,420 --> 00:42:42,171
I don't think it works like that.

786
00:42:42,755 --> 00:42:43,923
Of course it doesn't.

787
00:42:44,549 --> 00:42:48,177
-Where is this coming from, Matilda?
-What do you mean?

788
00:42:48,260 --> 00:42:49,887
I mean, it's incredible.

789
00:42:49,971 --> 00:42:52,932
But it's taking rather a dark turn.

790
00:42:53,015 --> 00:42:54,684
Maybe I shouldn't tell you any more.

791
00:42:54,767 --> 00:42:57,228
No, no, no. No.

792
00:42:57,311 --> 00:42:59,355
We must find out how it ends.

793
00:43:00,397 --> 00:43:02,608
All I'm saying is,
is everything all right?

794
00:43:02,691 --> 00:43:03,609
You could tell me.

795
00:43:03,692 --> 00:43:07,154
I'd better go, Mrs. Phelps, Mum's waiting.

796
00:43:07,238 --> 00:43:09,781
She gets so upset when she's away from me.

797
00:43:09,865 --> 00:43:13,327
She says every minute
is like an eternity so…

798
00:43:14,119 --> 00:43:16,622
Is she coming here? Can I meet her?

799
00:43:16,705 --> 00:43:18,164
Bye, Mrs. Phelps!

800
00:43:18,249 --> 00:43:20,542
Matilda, tomorrow I'm at the windmill.

801
00:43:20,626 --> 00:43:22,378
Okay, I'll find you.

802
00:43:24,254 --> 00:43:26,798
[the Wormwoods arguing faintly]

803
00:43:28,592 --> 00:43:30,010
I've got it.

804
00:43:30,093 --> 00:43:32,095
-Harry! Let me have it!
-[clattering]

805
00:43:32,178 --> 00:43:33,972
-[Harry grunting loudly]
-[Mrs. Wormwood yells]

806
00:43:34,055 --> 00:43:35,390
Hang on then.

807
00:43:35,473 --> 00:43:38,268
[both straining]

808
00:43:38,351 --> 00:43:40,436
-[Harry] You're hurting me!
-Yeah. Hold on, hold on.

809
00:43:44,399 --> 00:43:46,234
Let me pull, Harry.

810
00:43:46,317 --> 00:43:47,318
Pull then!

811
00:43:51,030 --> 00:43:53,324
[children chattering]

812
00:44:17,639 --> 00:44:18,473
Matilda.

813
00:44:21,977 --> 00:44:24,354
I believe your mind is extraordinary.

814
00:44:24,896 --> 00:44:27,524
So I'm taking things into my own hands.

815
00:44:28,650 --> 00:44:29,943
Starting tomorrow,

816
00:44:30,026 --> 00:44:32,529
I'm going to bring in a selection
of very clever books.

817
00:44:32,612 --> 00:44:35,114
You can sit and read them
while I teach the others,

818
00:44:35,198 --> 00:44:37,992
and if you have any questions, well…

819
00:44:38,076 --> 00:44:39,786
I shall do my best to answer them.

820
00:44:41,079 --> 00:44:42,288
How does that sound?

821
00:44:45,625 --> 00:44:48,336
[gasps, chuckles]

822
00:44:49,588 --> 00:44:50,755
Matilda…

823
00:44:52,215 --> 00:44:53,842
That is the biggest hug in the world.

824
00:44:55,176 --> 00:44:57,386
You're going to hug all the air out of me.

825
00:44:59,847 --> 00:45:01,890
[Agatha, over PA]
What a touching little scene.

826
00:45:06,229 --> 00:45:07,105
Move!

827
00:45:07,813 --> 00:45:12,901
I believe I said this maggot
was to receive no special treatment.

828
00:45:12,985 --> 00:45:16,238
In fact, I seem to recall informing you

829
00:45:16,322 --> 00:45:21,994
that this particular snot-ball
was evil incarnate, did I not?

830
00:45:22,077 --> 00:45:23,704
No, Miss Trunchbull, Matilda is not--

831
00:45:23,787 --> 00:45:25,497
Did you just say "no," Jenny?

832
00:45:27,082 --> 00:45:27,916
To me?

833
00:45:30,878 --> 00:45:34,256
Matilda Wormwood is a criminal.

834
00:45:35,966 --> 00:45:37,134
[over PA] This morning,

835
00:45:37,217 --> 00:45:41,513
a piece of my private
chocolate cake was stolen.

836
00:45:43,765 --> 00:45:47,394
It is my contention that you performed
this vileness, Wormwood, you.

837
00:45:47,477 --> 00:45:50,021
You have two choices,
admit your guilt and be punished,

838
00:45:50,104 --> 00:45:52,732
or call me a liar… and be punished.

839
00:45:56,027 --> 00:45:57,779
Think very carefully

840
00:45:57,862 --> 00:46:01,198
about what comes out
of your mouth, Wormwood.

841
00:46:01,783 --> 00:46:03,576
I did not stea--

842
00:46:03,660 --> 00:46:06,913
[loud, prolonged belch]

843
00:46:12,459 --> 00:46:14,045
[gasps]

844
00:46:31,144 --> 00:46:32,688
[gasping]

845
00:46:38,026 --> 00:46:39,402
Chocolate.

846
00:46:40,111 --> 00:46:42,447
Bruce Bogtrotter.

847
00:46:44,616 --> 00:46:46,785
[timidly] Yes, Miss Trunchbull?

848
00:46:48,244 --> 00:46:50,580
Thank you, Maurice, that will be all.

849
00:46:51,957 --> 00:46:53,792
[grunting]

850
00:46:53,875 --> 00:46:58,129
Staff dismissed. Come on.
Everybody out. Everybody out, come on.

851
00:46:58,213 --> 00:46:59,130
[Agatha] Move!

852
00:47:11,309 --> 00:47:12,935
You liked my cake…

853
00:47:13,894 --> 00:47:15,020
didn't you, Bruce?

854
00:47:15,104 --> 00:47:18,190
Yes, Miss Trunchbull,
it was very delicious.

855
00:47:18,273 --> 00:47:19,734
So chocolatey.

856
00:47:20,317 --> 00:47:22,194
And I'm really very sorry, I--

857
00:47:22,277 --> 00:47:23,112
No, no…

858
00:47:23,988 --> 00:47:27,241
Just so long as you enjoyed the cake.
That's the main thing.

859
00:47:28,533 --> 00:47:29,368
Is it?

860
00:47:30,911 --> 00:47:32,454
[singsong] Oh, Cook.

861
00:47:50,555 --> 00:47:51,765
[cook coughs]

862
00:47:54,518 --> 00:47:55,351
Be still!

863
00:47:58,437 --> 00:48:00,732
What's the matter, Bogtrotter?
Lost your appetite?

864
00:48:01,274 --> 00:48:04,986
Don't worry… all you have to do
is eat every last crumb.

865
00:48:06,404 --> 00:48:10,366
And if you perform this incredible feat,
I promise you,

866
00:48:10,449 --> 00:48:12,285
all will be forgiven.

867
00:48:12,368 --> 00:48:14,287
[hesitating] Every crumb?

868
00:48:15,413 --> 00:48:17,581
-But I'm full.

as he struggled in his chains,

1038
00:58:51,408 --> 00:58:54,326
knowing that the tiniest, weeniest mistake

1039
00:58:54,411 --> 00:58:57,288
would mean that he'd lose her
and their child forever.

1040
00:58:57,914 --> 00:58:59,999
Seven seconds, and suddenly…

1041
00:59:00,082 --> 00:59:02,334
-[yells loudly]
-[Matilda] She let go!

1042
00:59:06,130 --> 00:59:09,175
The escapologist reached out
with one huge, massive arm

1043
00:59:09,258 --> 00:59:10,509
to catch his wife and the child.

1044
00:59:10,592 --> 00:59:12,303
-[acrobat gasps]
-[grunts]

1045
00:59:12,386 --> 00:59:14,221
-[Matilda] Eight seconds!
-No, I can't look.

1046
00:59:14,305 --> 00:59:17,433
Nine seconds! Ten seconds! And…

1047
00:59:18,100 --> 00:59:21,478
And… And… Eleven seconds!

1048
00:59:21,562 --> 00:59:26,233
He grabbed the dynamite
and flung it far, far away!

1049
00:59:26,317 --> 00:59:30,236
Hurray! So this story does
have a happy ending after all.

1050
00:59:31,071 --> 00:59:31,905
No.

1051
00:59:33,574 --> 00:59:34,491
No, it doesn't.

1052
00:59:35,742 --> 00:59:37,243
[crowd gasping]

1053
00:59:37,327 --> 00:59:38,579
[acrobat exclaims]

1054
00:59:47,796 --> 00:59:50,966
No! Was she okay? Did she survive?

1055
00:59:51,549 --> 00:59:54,219
She broke every bone in her body.

1056
00:59:54,885 --> 00:59:57,097
Except the ones at the ends
of her little fingers.

1057
00:59:58,056 --> 01:00:00,975
She did manage to live long enough
to have their child.

1058
01:00:01,058 --> 01:00:03,478
[baby fussing]

1059
01:00:04,895 --> 01:00:06,564
But the effort was too great.

1060
01:00:08,148 --> 01:00:09,775
Love our girl.

1061
01:00:11,444 --> 01:00:14,989
Love our daughter with all your heart.

1062
01:00:16,616 --> 01:00:19,409
She is all we ever wanted.

1063
01:00:26,208 --> 01:00:28,127
[crying softly]

1064
01:00:29,669 --> 01:00:30,838
And then she died.

1065
01:00:33,673 --> 01:00:34,716
And then…

1066
01:00:35,717 --> 01:00:37,094
things got worse.

1067
01:00:37,177 --> 01:00:38,720
What? Worse?

1068
01:00:38,803 --> 01:00:40,389
I'm afraid they did.

1069
01:00:40,472 --> 01:00:42,849
Because the escapologist was so kind

1070
01:00:42,932 --> 01:00:47,020
that he never for one second blamed
the evil stepsister for what happened.

1071
01:00:47,896 --> 01:00:52,692
In fact, he asked her to move in
and help look after his daughter.

1072
01:00:52,776 --> 01:00:55,153
[Mrs. Phelps] No, no,
don't ask her to move in.

1073
01:00:55,236 --> 01:00:57,488
She was nothing but cruel
to the little girl,

1074
01:00:57,572 --> 01:01:00,700
making her wash and clean
all day long. Shouting,

1075
01:01:00,784 --> 01:01:03,202
[Matilda and stepsister]
"Clean the floor and I'll be nice!"

1076
01:01:03,286 --> 01:01:06,455
When the little girl did clean it,
she was even crueler

1077
01:01:06,539 --> 01:01:09,417
because she was
a terrible, terrible cheat!

1078
01:01:09,500 --> 01:01:10,626
I hate cheats!

1079
01:01:10,709 --> 01:01:14,672
All in secret, so the escapologist
never suspected a thing.

1080
01:01:14,755 --> 01:01:17,758
And so the poor little girl grew up
with the meanest, cruelest,

1081
01:01:17,841 --> 01:01:20,886
horriblest aunt
you could possibly imagine!

1082
01:01:20,969 --> 01:01:23,055
Let's call the police! [panting]

1083
01:01:24,056 --> 01:01:25,223
Mrs. Phelps.

1084
01:01:26,141 --> 01:01:27,685
It's just a story.

1085
01:01:28,268 --> 01:01:29,144
What?

1086
01:01:31,354 --> 01:01:33,732
Oh. Yes, of course.

1087
01:01:34,399 --> 01:01:35,400
A story.

1088
01:01:36,193 --> 01:01:38,528
It's just, you make it so real.

1089
01:01:39,404 --> 01:01:41,114
[relieved laugh] Your mind, Matilda.

1090
01:01:41,614 --> 01:01:45,077
Your parents must think they've won
the lottery with a child like you.

1091
01:01:45,702 --> 01:01:47,745
Oh… they do.

1092
01:01:48,705 --> 01:01:50,290
They're always saying that.

1093
01:01:50,373 --> 01:01:52,875
In fact, they say,

1094
01:01:52,960 --> 01:01:56,546
"We're so proud of you, Matilda,
you're like winning the…"

1095
01:02:00,383 --> 01:02:02,802
Yeah. I'd better go.

1096
01:02:05,263 --> 01:02:07,599
[shrieking]

1097
01:02:07,682 --> 01:02:10,893
It's just like winning the lottery!

1098

1099

Me?

1100
01:02:13,855 --> 01:02:16,315
You? No, you're like
eating someone else's bogeys.

1101
01:02:16,398 --> 01:02:18,651
Like winning a snottery, you, boy.

1102
01:02:18,735 --> 01:02:19,777
I'm a girl.

1103
01:02:19,861 --> 01:02:21,612
But how, Harry?

1104
01:02:21,696 --> 01:02:23,280
Remember that big, muscly idiot?

1105
01:02:23,364 --> 01:02:26,033
Turns out he had a whole lot
of muscly mates.

1106
01:02:26,117 --> 01:02:27,701
Bucketloads of cash.

1107
01:02:27,784 --> 01:02:30,121
Everyone wanting a luxury car.

1108
01:02:30,204 --> 01:02:34,375
All I had was a load of old bangers,
each with 100,000 miles on the clock.

1109
01:02:34,458 --> 01:02:37,461
So, I did what any decent
business leader would.

1110
01:02:37,544 --> 01:02:38,587
What?

1111
01:02:38,670 --> 01:02:39,963
I bought a drill.

1112
01:02:40,046 --> 01:02:43,967
Attached it to the speedometer
and whacked it in reverse.

1113
01:02:44,050 --> 01:02:46,512
I put back the mileage
on every one of those cars

1114
01:02:46,595 --> 01:02:50,181
and sold them to those big,
muscly idiots, resulting in…

1115
01:02:50,265 --> 01:02:51,975
Money!

1116
01:02:52,058 --> 01:02:53,184
But you cheated them!

1117
01:02:54,519 --> 01:02:55,436
Excuse me?

1118
01:02:55,520 --> 01:02:58,982
You cheated them.
What you did, it wasn't right.

1119
01:02:59,065 --> 01:03:00,525
You're just a cheat!

1120
01:03:01,109 --> 01:03:03,486
Oh, the little pig!

1121
01:03:04,612 --> 01:03:07,991
It's the books, Harry.
It's the books and the stories.

1122
01:03:08,074 --> 01:03:09,367
Is it now?

1123
01:03:10,243 --> 01:03:11,077
Books, is it?

1124
01:03:13,871 --> 01:03:15,623
You know what I'm going to do tomorrow?

1125
01:03:16,124 --> 01:03:17,708
I'm going to go down to that library,

1126
01:03:18,501 --> 01:03:22,880
I'm going to tell that old bag
to never let you in again.

1127
01:03:22,963 --> 01:03:24,256
What?

1128
01:03:24,340 --> 01:03:27,134
Always sticking your nose in
where it don't belong.

1129
01:03:27,885 --> 01:03:32,014

[gasping]

1131
01:03:40,105 --> 01:03:44,818
That night, the escapologist's daughter
cried herself to sleep.

1132
01:03:44,902 --> 01:03:48,613
She never said a word
about the evil step-aunt's bullying.

1133
01:03:48,697 --> 01:03:51,033
She didn't want to add
to her father's pain.

1134
01:03:51,741 --> 01:03:55,245
This only encouraged the woman
to greater cruelties,

1135
01:03:55,329 --> 01:03:58,665
until one day she exploded.

1136
01:03:59,416 --> 01:04:02,210
[Agatha and Matilda] Sticking your
nose in where it doesn't belong!

1137

You nasty little creep!

1138
01:04:04,713 --> 01:04:07,841
And she threw her…
threw her into a dank,

1139
01:04:07,924 --> 01:04:11,469
dark, dusty cellar,
locked the door and went out.

[car approaching]

1141
01:04:14,598 --> 01:04:18,267
But that night, the escapologist
happened to come home early.

1142
01:04:19,853 --> 01:04:22,730
And when he heard the sound
of his daughter's tears,

1143
01:04:22,814 --> 01:04:25,191
-he smashed the door open.

with that incredible mind of yours.

You mean, there's no room in my head

But I'm poorer even than most.

1430
01:22:53,270 --> 01:22:56,857
You see, my father died when I was young.

1431
01:22:56,941 --> 01:23:00,319
Magnus was his name. He was so kind.

1432
01:23:01,028 --> 01:23:04,406
[sighing] But… when he was gone,

1433
01:23:04,489 --> 01:23:06,992
my aunt became my legal guardian.

1434
01:23:07,659 --> 01:23:12,497
And she was cruel and mean
like you cannot even imagine.

1435
01:23:13,082 --> 01:23:16,668
Then when I became a teacher,
she presented me with a bill.

1436
01:23:17,461 --> 01:23:18,837
She'd written everything down.

1437
01:23:18,920 --> 01:23:23,258
Every teabag, every gas bill,
every tin of beans.

1438
01:23:23,342 --> 01:23:27,053
She made me sign a contract
to pay her back every single penny.

1439
01:23:27,554 --> 01:23:28,388
Really?

1440
01:23:28,472 --> 01:23:32,225
She even produced a document that said
that my father gave her his house.

1441
01:23:33,184 --> 01:23:36,062
But did he really do that, Magnus,

1442
01:23:36,145 --> 01:23:38,189
did he just give her his house?

1443
01:23:39,232 --> 01:23:43,319
Well, I've always felt it was…
suspicious.

1444
01:23:43,903 --> 01:23:47,240
You see, she said his death
was an accident, but…

You think she did him in!

1446

Well, I cannot say for sure.

bullied by that woman made me, well…

01:32:59,319 --> 01:33:00,362
Children…

1545
01:33:01,988 --> 01:33:05,784
How can I be your headmistress

1546
01:33:05,867 --> 01:33:11,122
if I cannot chill you to the bone?

1547
01:33:11,790 --> 01:33:12,624
Mm?

1548
01:33:13,332 --> 01:33:16,836
If the small ones don't pee just a little

1549
01:33:16,920 --> 01:33:19,047
when I walk into the room,
well then I'm…

1550
01:33:19,923 --> 01:33:24,719
failing as an educator.

1551
01:33:27,889 --> 01:33:28,764
So…

1552
01:33:30,141 --> 01:33:32,685
Today we are going
to have a spelling test.

1553
01:33:34,353 --> 01:33:40,776
And any child who gets one
single answer wrong…

1554
01:33:41,985 --> 01:33:45,448
goes to Chokey.

1555
01:33:45,531 --> 01:33:46,990
You can't do that!

1556
01:33:48,200 --> 01:33:49,785
Oh, really? Why?

1557
01:33:49,868 --> 01:33:52,079
Because of yesterday's little…

1558
01:33:52,162 --> 01:33:53,872
[mimics explosion]

1559
01:33:53,956 --> 01:33:55,916
…incident, you mean?

1560
01:33:56,667 --> 01:33:59,127
Well, here's a surprise Chokey.

1561
01:34:01,672 --> 01:34:03,381
[gasping]

1562
01:34:03,924 --> 01:34:05,133
-You!
-[gasps]

1563
01:34:06,301 --> 01:34:07,970
Spell, oh, let me see…

1564
01:34:08,553 --> 01:34:09,554
"newt."

1565
01:34:09,637 --> 01:34:13,934
N-E-W-T. Newt.

1566
01:34:15,602 --> 01:34:16,436
What?

1567
01:34:17,312 --> 01:34:18,313
How do you know that?

1568
01:34:18,396 --> 01:34:21,399
Miss Honey taught us.
She's very good at teaching.

1569
01:34:22,859 --> 01:34:24,110
Nonsense!

1570
01:34:24,193 --> 01:34:27,905
Miss Honey's far too soft and peachy

1571
01:34:27,989 --> 01:34:29,741
to be good at anything!

1572
01:34:29,824 --> 01:34:30,867
You!

1573
01:34:31,826 --> 01:34:35,788
Spell the one thing you all are.

1574
01:34:35,872 --> 01:34:38,833
Spell "revolting."

1575
01:34:39,416 --> 01:34:43,295
Revolting. R-E-V-O-L-T…

1576
01:34:44,463 --> 01:34:46,048
I-N-G. Revolting.

1577
01:34:46,132 --> 01:34:48,050
You're cheating, pigtails!

1578
01:34:48,134 --> 01:34:51,345
Of course she's not cheating!
She's simply spelling the word.

1579
01:34:51,428 --> 01:34:53,722
I just taught them with kindness
and patience and respect.

1580
01:34:53,805 --> 01:34:56,392
How dare you bring
those words into my classroom!

1581
01:34:57,976 --> 01:35:00,812
You. Snot-nose.

1582
01:35:01,522 --> 01:35:02,773
Stand and spell…

1583
01:35:04,400 --> 01:35:08,945
"amchellakamanialseptricolistimosis."

1584
01:35:09,029 --> 01:35:10,906
But that's not even a word.

1585
01:35:10,989 --> 01:35:12,407
Spell it or go to Chokey.

1586
01:35:12,491 --> 01:35:14,450
And I should warn you,
it has silent letters.

1587

and every one of you has failed.

1617
