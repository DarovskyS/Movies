176
00:12:08,640 --> 00:12:10,295
<i>Wanted to say thanks.</i>

177
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:14,466
<i>Take a look inside, a gift for
all the years of hard work.</i>

178
00:12:14,640 --> 00:12:16,465
<i>Sorry about the neg roll.</i>

179
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:18,919
<i>I spilled some blood on it...</i>

180
00:12:18,920 --> 00:12:20,799
<i>while self-stitching
a gun wound to my abdomen...</i>

181
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:24,159
<i>but number 25 is my best ever.</i>

182
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:27,159
<i>The quintessence

183
00:12:27,160 --> 00:12:29,599
<i>I trust you'll get it
where it needs to go...</i>

184
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:31,470
<i>you always do.</i>

185
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:52,901
What did you get?

186
00:12:54,840 --> 00:12:56,505
It's a wallet.

187
00:13:03,720 --> 00:13:05,829
With <i>LIFE's</i> motto on it.

188
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,586
Here you go.

189
00:13:21,720 --> 00:13:23,863
Where's 25?
It's not there.

<font color="#808080">(LOUD KNOCKING ON DOOR)</font>

191
00:13:26,360 --> 00:13:29,504
Hey, we need negative 25.

192
00:13:29,720 --> 00:13:32,559
Sean O'Connell sent a telegram.

193
00:13:32,560 --> 00:13:33,719
An actual telegram.

194
00:13:33,720 --> 00:13:35,988
A 100-year-old dude
came in a little hat.

195
00:13:37,080 --> 00:13:38,586
So there's a floor meeting.

196
00:13:39,240 --> 00:13:41,190
Bring 25.

197
00:13:44,560 --> 00:13:47,067
It's here somewhere.
We'll find it.

198
00:13:47,080 --> 00:13:49,799
Okay, make a contact sheet of
these frames as soon as you can.

199
00:13:49,800 --> 00:13:50,999
And don't say anything to anyone.

200
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:52,381
Yeah.

201
00:13:52,400 --> 00:13:56,625
I just wanted to inform you
all reluctantly, that...

202
00:14:02,600 --> 00:14:05,479
I guess, just start back
from the beginning.

203
00:14:05,480 --> 00:14:08,759
Okay. I just wanted to inform
you all reluctantly...

204
00:14:08,760 --> 00:14:12,428
that this month's issue
will be our last.

205
00:14:12,760 --> 00:14:13,919
What?

206
00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:15,221
Yeah. What?

207
00:14:15,640 --> 00:14:17,624
This is some bull!

208
00:14:18,120 --> 00:14:19,467
It's sad...

209
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:22,748
news, for sure.

210
00:14:24,120 --> 00:14:26,279
Now, you're all valued employees.

211
00:14:26,280 --> 00:14:30,079
But as we undergo this
transition to <i>LIFE</i> online...

212
00:14:30,080 --> 00:14:31,799
we wanted to be candid with you...

213
00:14:31,800 --> 00:14:35,519
that some of you will be
determined non-vital employees...

214
00:14:35,520 --> 00:14:37,319
to the new partnership.

215
00:14:37,320 --> 00:14:39,479
And we'll be deciding
which of those positions...

216
00:14:39,480 --> 00:14:42,999
will be remaining with us over
the course of the next week.

217
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:47,350
Also, we feel sad about
that, as you can see.

219
00:14:48,600 --> 00:14:49,759
Now for some good news.

220
00:14:49,760 --> 00:14:52,062
We are very excited...
All right, Don.

221
00:14:52,440 --> 00:14:56,028
Ted Hendricks. Managing
director of the transition.

222
00:14:56,760 --> 00:14:59,586
Never fun, this stage.

223
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:03,079
But we do have ahead of us
the privilege of publishing...

224
00:15:03,080 --> 00:15:07,146
what will be the very last
issue of <i>LIFE</i> magazine.

225
00:15:07,320 --> 00:15:10,479
And for the final issue,
we just received a telegram.

226
00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:11,599
Come on.

227
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:14,079
From Sean O'Connell...

228
00:15:14,080 --> 00:15:16,399
who has never,
I'm told, been willing...

229
00:15:16,400 --> 00:15:18,439
to speak with the executives here.

230
00:15:18,440 --> 00:15:20,159
Well, he broke his long silence

231
00:15:20,160 --> 00:15:21,919
and shared his thoughts with us...

232
00:15:21,920 --> 00:15:25,064
through that old man.

233
00:15:26,680 --> 00:15:28,199
Sean O'Connell.

234
00:15:28,200 --> 00:15:33,267
"I expect full consideration
of negative 25 for cover."

235
00:15:33,280 --> 00:15:34,959
"My most grand."

236
00:15:34,960 --> 00:15:38,628
"The quintessence of life."

237
00:15:39,680 --> 00:15:41,106
What is that?

238
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:43,599
It means like the
fullest and most rich.

239
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:46,079
Okay. So our cover will probably
be the most famous ever...

240
00:15:46,080 --> 00:15:49,759
because it really will have the
big quintessence of all time.

241
00:15:49,760 --> 00:15:53,269
Very full and so rich.

242
00:15:55,720 --> 00:15:57,559
So let's see this thing. Huh?

243
00:15:57,560 --> 00:15:59,039
Let's see it.

244
00:15:59,040 --> 00:16:01,919
Can we... What am I doing up here?
What's going on?

245
00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:03,559
We'll receive it now
from Negative Assets.

246
00:16:03,560 --> 00:16:04,919
This gentleman.
The last man in.

247
00:16:04,920 --> 00:16:06,279
Negative Assets.
What's that?

248
00:16:06,280 --> 00:16:07,661
Ah, Major Tom.

249
00:16:08,200 --> 00:16:10,901
Can I get that?

250
00:16:13,400 --> 00:16:15,589
It's being processed.

251
00:16:16,160 --> 00:16:17,479
All right. Well, let's do it.

252
00:16:17,480 --> 00:16:20,215
Let's process some quintessence.

253
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:21,541
Come on.

254
00:16:22,080 --> 00:16:23,381
Go.

255
00:16:23,680 --> 00:16:24,759
Now.

256
00:16:24,760 --> 00:16:26,439
That's why I'm clapping.

257
00:16:26,440 --> 00:16:28,708
When do we go to press?
Two and a half weeks.

258
00:16:42,360 --> 00:16:43,661
Hi.

259
00:16:43,840 --> 00:16:45,141
Hi.

260
00:16:45,520 --> 00:16:47,948
I'm Walter.

262
00:16:50,640 --> 00:16:51,987
Yes.

00:16:57,440 --> 00:16:58,919
Yes. I am.

266
00:16:58,920 --> 00:17:01,919
You're processing the last cover photo.
That's a big deal.

267
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:04,999
Yeah, it's... there's a...
we have a glitch.

268
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:06,599
Mini, on that one right now.

269
00:17:06,600 --> 00:17:08,470
I wanted to say, to you...

270
00:17:08,960 --> 00:17:13,185
do you maybe have an address
for Sean O'Connell?

271
00:17:13,920 --> 00:17:16,199
Um... It's not really
that easy with him.

272
00:17:16,200 --> 00:17:18,039
He moves around so much. I don't.

273
00:17:18,040 --> 00:17:19,439
Yeah, he's on a freelance.

274
00:17:19,440 --> 00:17:22,359
I don't know where and
he doesn't have a phone.

275
00:17:22,360 --> 00:17:25,140
No phone? He's old school.
Yeah.

276
00:17:28,080 --> 00:17:30,039
But, you know, why don't
I check with Peg?

277
00:17:30,040 --> 00:17:31,999
I know she just processed
a check for him.

278
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:35,110
And we could track his pay-out maybe.
Find him that way?

279
00:17:35,400 --> 00:17:38,439
Cool. Very cool.
Okay.

280
00:17:38,440 --> 00:17:40,239
Walter.
Yes.

281
00:17:40,240 --> 00:17:41,679
I'm on it.

282
00:17:41,680 --> 00:17:43,039
Thanks.

283
00:17:43,040 --> 00:17:44,359
Yes. Are you coming?

284
00:17:44,360 --> 00:17:46,135
Yes, I'm not.

285
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:48,383
Yes, I have to stay.

286
00:17:50,040 --> 00:17:52,820
Here's the contact sheet.

287
00:17:58,560 --> 00:17:59,959
What do you see?

288
00:17:59,960 --> 00:18:02,239
This photo cluster.
These three.

289
00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:04,119
They're the only printable ones.

290
00:18:04,120 --> 00:18:06,519
He took them around the
same time he took 25.

291
00:18:06,520 --> 00:18:09,119
They could give us a clue
to where Sean is.

292
00:18:09,120 --> 00:18:10,239
Blow them up, all right?

293
00:18:10,240 --> 00:18:11,541
Cool.

She's gonna get back to me.

These? No,
these are loupes.

301
00:18:45,960 --> 00:18:47,719
They're for work.
They magnify the...

302
00:18:47,720 --> 00:18:49,879
Is that 25? Can I see?

303
00:18:49,880 --> 00:18:51,261
That's... No.

304
00:18:51,760 --> 00:18:54,759
I can't quite find 25...

305
00:18:54,760 --> 00:18:56,439
just now.

306
00:18:56,440 --> 00:18:58,079
You can't find it?

307
00:18:58,080 --> 00:19:00,039
Yeah. That's why
I'm trying to find Sean.

308
00:19:00,040 --> 00:19:04,550
I'm trying to track him down
somehow with these other images.

309
00:19:05,320 --> 00:19:06,559
His whereabouts?

310
00:19:06,560 --> 00:19:08,021
Yeah.

311
00:19:09,720 --> 00:19:12,546
I take this class,
Writing the Mystery Novel.

312
00:19:12,920 --> 00:19:15,079
Anyway, they say the key
is to work backwards.

313
00:19:15,080 --> 00:19:18,639
You connect the clues and then
scatter them so they seem unrelated.

314
00:19:18,640 --> 00:19:20,704
There's like a whole
science to it.

315
00:19:21,120 --> 00:19:22,865
May I?
Sure.

316
00:19:23,680 --> 00:19:26,135
Okay. Thumb.

317
00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:28,919
Yeah. It's an unknown thumb.

318
00:19:28,920 --> 00:19:31,143
Okay. Water?

319
00:19:32,160 --> 00:19:33,479
Just water, I guess?

320
00:19:33,480 --> 00:19:34,639
Yeah, just water.

321
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:35,839
Okay.

322
00:19:35,840 --> 00:19:37,471
And...

323
00:19:38,600 --> 00:19:41,359
like a curved piece of...

324
00:19:41,360 --> 00:19:45,460
some kind of, part of a thing.

But the thing with clues,
my teacher says...

326
00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:52,279
is you really only need one good
one, and then they'll connect...

327
00:19:52,280 --> 00:19:55,199
and you'll be like, "Oh, yes, of
course, unknown thumb, water..."

328
00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:57,821
"I should have seen this
the whole time. Ahh!"

329
00:19:58,200 --> 00:20:01,310
<font color="#808080">(LAUGHS)</font>
Yeah, yeah, I'll be like...

330
00:20:05,120 --> 00:20:09,470

back and try not to get fired.

350
00:21:18,240 --> 00:21:21,879
but it has a more generous, piano kind
of size living room for you though.

351
00:21:21,880 --> 00:21:23,439
Yeah. Yeah,
this is good.

352
00:21:23,440 --> 00:21:24,799
On move-in,
you'd need first month's,

353
00:21:24,800 --> 00:21:26,119
last month's, and full deposit.

354
00:21:26,120 --> 00:21:28,184
That's $4,700.
Great.

355
00:21:28,200 --> 00:21:29,319
Yeah, okay.

356
00:21:29,320 --> 00:21:30,799
Yeah, we'll take it.
I'll get the paperwork.

357

open in three weeks.

358
00:21:33,080 --> 00:21:34,506

385
00:22:29,560 --> 00:22:30,799
Oh.

386
00:22:30,800 --> 00:22:33,719
You should donate that, because
you never used it, to a poor kid.

Well, I really

You know, when your daddy died...

395
00:22:52,440 --> 00:22:54,799
and then you went to work
in that pizza place...

396
00:22:54,800 --> 00:22:58,359

had that father kind of name.

I never even thought about that.

403
00:23:11,040 --> 00:23:13,119

00:28:54,480 --> 00:28:55,679
He gave this to you?

523
00:28:55,680 --> 00:28:57,186
Yeah.

524
00:28:58,320 --> 00:29:00,622
I like that,
"TO DRAW CLOSER."

525
00:29:03,640 --> 00:29:05,839
So, what's he like in person?

526
00:29:05,840 --> 00:29:07,301
Sean?
Yeah.

527
00:29:08,160 --> 00:29:10,839
Well, I haven't actually met him.

528
00:29:10,840 --> 00:29:12,839
I mean, we talk a lot, but...

529
00:29:12,840 --> 00:29:15,999
I've been his point guy here
ever since I started.

530
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:17,825
How long ago was that?

531
00:29:18,840 --> 00:29:20,159
16 years.

532
00:29:20,160 --> 00:29:21,439
16 years?

533
00:29:21,440 --> 00:29:23,039
Oh, my gosh. Wow.

534
00:29:23,040 --> 00:29:24,519
Well, you have
nothing to worry about.

535
00:29:24,520 --> 00:29:26,199
With the layoffs, I mean.

536
00:29:26,200 --> 00:29:28,279
I've been here for a month.

537
00:29:28,280 --> 00:29:30,582
"Last in, first out," right?

538
00:29:31,280 --> 00:29:32,661
<font color="#808080">(PHONE RINGING)</font>
Oh. Sorry.

539
00:29:34,680 --> 00:29:36,869
It's Rich's dad.

540
00:29:37,440 --> 00:29:39,039

I don't know.

544
00:29:49,920 --> 00:29:52,871
So, what kind of skateboard
does your son have?

545
00:29:53,600 --> 00:29:55,575
Um, I have no idea!

546
00:29:55,600 --> 00:29:57,719
It's oblong. I don't know.

547
00:29:57,720 --> 00:30:00,341
Why?
No, I just...

548
00:30:00,640 --> 00:30:04,865
I used to... I was kind
of into the scene.

549
00:30:05,400 --> 00:30:06,999
The skateboard scene?
Yeah.

550
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:08,347
Wow!

551
00:30:08,760 --> 00:30:10,279
Hi, Peg.

552
00:30:10,280 --> 00:30:13,709
Yeah, it's Sean O'Connell, we
actually need to find him.

553
00:30:15,880 --> 00:30:18,387
Yes. If you could hurry.

554
00:30:18,600 --> 00:30:20,079
Kickflip.

555
00:30:20,080 --> 00:30:21,620
Yeah.

556
00:30:21,720 --> 00:30:23,784
It's a good one
for the repertoire.

557
00:30:24,600 --> 00:30:26,119
I'm Walter.

558
00:30:26,120 --> 00:30:27,319
Rich.

559
00:30:27,320 --> 00:30:29,959
Yeah, we think he might know
something or have an asset we need.

560
00:30:29,960 --> 00:30:31,639
You know, you just got to get
a little more snap...

561
00:30:31,640 --> 00:30:33,385
get that thing up there.

562
00:30:34,240 --> 00:30:36,304
Want me to show you something?

563
00:30:36,640 --> 00:30:38,544
Sure.

564
00:30:40,280 --> 00:30:41,581
Here.

565
00:30:42,440 --> 00:30:43,759
I like your trucks.

566
00:30:43,760 --> 00:30:45,141
Thanks.

567
00:30:46,160 --> 00:30:47,905
Now check this out.

568
00:30:49,600 --> 00:30:51,735
Know about the flick?
Uh-huh.

569
00:30:51,760 --> 00:30:55,223
Yeah, we've finished processing
his April work order.

570
00:31:01,640 --> 00:31:03,908
Yes, it's kind of important.

571
00:31:06,440 --> 00:31:09,710
Did you forward the job 1090s?

572
00:31:10,080 --> 00:31:12,064
Or his last salary?

573
00:31:12,960 --> 00:31:14,421
Wow!

574
00:31:17,960 --> 00:31:19,386
Wow!

575
00:31:19,520 --> 00:31:21,079
Here you go.
That was awesome.

576
00:31:21,080 --> 00:31:22,279
So it could be either place.

577
00:31:22,280 --> 00:31:24,079
Thanks, Walter.
Okay. Thanks, Peg.

578
00:31:24,080 --> 00:31:25,381
All right.

579
00:31:26,480 --> 00:31:27,799
Hey, so...

580
00:31:27,800 --> 00:31:29,639
Sean's definitely not in New York.

581
00:31:29,640 --> 00:31:31,359
Peg said she sent multiples.

582
00:31:31,360 --> 00:31:33,519
I don't know if you know
how it works with him.

583
00:31:33,520 --> 00:31:36,519
She sends copies because we
never know where he's gonna be.

584
00:31:36,520 --> 00:31:39,839
And this week she sent 1090s
to Princeton, New Jersey.

585
00:31:39,840 --> 00:31:42,039
Oh, great.
Train ride.

586
00:31:42,040 --> 00:31:43,639
And one to Greenland.

587
00:31:43,640 --> 00:31:44,941
Just in case.

588
00:31:45,480 --> 00:31:47,464
Greenland, the country?

589
00:31:48,200 --> 00:31:49,581
That's...

590
00:31:50,600 --> 00:31:52,199
You can't take a train there.

591
00:31:52,200 --> 00:31:53,519
No.

592
00:31:53,520 --> 00:31:55,519
Well, maybe he's in Jersey.
Yeah.

593
00:31:55,520 --> 00:31:58,519
Yeah, is your phone done
buffering with that ship's name?

594
00:31:58,520 --> 00:32:00,719
Yes! Look.
Here it is.

595
00:32:00,720 --> 00:32:03,182

Benjamin Buttons thing.

620

Where you get old, but smaller.

621
00:33:01,280 --> 00:33:04,663
Or whatever, and become a
gradual old baby. Or something.

622

don't really know how it works.

I wanted to tell you,
that song, "Major Tom"?

654
00:34:38,040 --> 00:34:41,025
Back there, when
the beard guy was...

655
00:34:41,640 --> 00:34:42,999
He doesn't know what
he's talking about.

656
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:47,350
That song is about courage
and going into the unknown.

An American? Sean O'Connell?

701
00:40:00,440 --> 00:40:03,471
I think he might have received
mail at this address.

702
00:40:03,680 --> 00:40:06,062
You want a drink?

703
00:40:06,600 --> 00:40:08,504
Okay. Yeah, I guess...

704
00:40:10,200 --> 00:40:13,495
a small beer shoe.

705
00:40:13,520 --> 00:40:15,759
So, could somebody get mail here?

706
00:40:15,760 --> 00:40:16,879
Heli mail.

707
00:40:16,880 --> 00:40:18,181
"Heli mail"?

708
00:40:18,200 --> 00:40:21,519
We helicopter mail to the
ships when they pass by.

709
00:40:21,520 --> 00:40:23,839
We are pub and helipad.

710
00:40:23,840 --> 00:40:26,439
Yeah. Wait, the <i>Erkigsnek?</i>

711
00:40:26,440 --> 00:40:27,999
Yeah. <i>Erkigsnek.</i>

712
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:29,495
<i>Erkigsnek.</i>

713
00:40:29,520 --> 00:40:31,982
We flew mail to her Tuesday.

714
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:34,679
I'm gonna take it
down a little, here.

715
00:40:34,680 --> 00:40:36,823
I just want to
speak from the heart.

716
00:40:36,840 --> 00:40:38,824
I lost a good lady.

717
00:40:39,040 --> 00:40:42,310
I feel this song is helping me
feel like I'm not alone.

718
00:40:42,800 --> 00:40:46,263
Even though I pretty much am.

719
00:40:46,280 --> 00:40:47,615
Come on, let's sing it.

720
00:40:47,640 --> 00:40:49,279
Everyone.

721
00:40:49,280 --> 00:40:50,599
Let's sing it together.

722
00:40:50,600 --> 00:40:52,959
<i>Don't you want me, baby?</i>

723
00:40:52,960 --> 00:40:55,039
Do you know who
flies the mail out?

724
00:40:55,040 --> 00:40:57,039
Do you have regular pilots?

725
00:40:57,040 --> 00:40:58,119
Hey, man.

726
00:40:58,120 --> 00:40:59,999
Just keep it going, man.

727
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:01,399
Hey.
Sing it.

728
00:41:01,400 --> 00:41:03,959
No, no, thank you.
I'm all right.

729
00:41:03,960 --> 00:41:05,599
Come on, man. Go on.

730
00:41:05,600 --> 00:41:07,599
<i>I was working as a waitress.</i>

731
00:41:07,600 --> 00:41:10,479
Yeah, I know it.
I'm okay. Thank you.

732
00:41:10,480 --> 00:41:12,679
I'm on a business trip,
I'm working.

733
00:41:12,680 --> 00:41:14,948
Come on, man. This song
is important to me.

734
00:41:15,880 --> 00:41:16,919
Yeah.
Yeah.

735
00:41:16,920 --> 00:41:18,159
Sing it.
Okay.

736
00:41:18,160 --> 00:41:22,919
<i>I was working as a waitress in a
cocktail bar that much is true.</i>

737
00:41:22,920 --> 00:41:24,267
Okay?

738
00:41:24,440 --> 00:41:25,959
That sucked.

739
00:41:25,960 --> 00:41:27,079
Do your work.

740
00:41:27,080 --> 00:41:28,381
You don't have to push.

741
00:41:29,120 --> 00:41:31,343
What if I poke you?
Don't poke me.

742
00:41:31,840 --> 00:41:33,359
Do your work, man.
Don't poke me!

743
00:41:33,360 --> 00:41:35,039
I'm poking you.
What am I doing?

744
00:41:35,040 --> 00:41:37,229
Stop poking me!
Don't poke me!

to you about your thumb!

<font color="#804040">MAN</font>: Yeah. I flew mail out
to the <i>Erkigsnek</i> Tuesday.

752
00:42:02,560 --> 00:42:04,919
Gave him a ride.

753
00:42:04,920 --> 00:42:08,383
He took that photo
of my hand on the stick.

754
00:42:09,160 --> 00:42:13,431
I'm just blown away
I located your thumb.

755
00:42:14,800 --> 00:42:17,580
There is, like, eight
people in Greenland.

756
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:23,588
I mean, it's a good
place to find a thumb.

757
00:42:26,040 --> 00:42:28,799
Don't cheat on your lady, man...

758
00:42:28,800 --> 00:42:32,104
when you live in a country that
only has eight people in it.

759
00:42:32,360 --> 00:42:34,025
By the way.

760
00:42:34,600 --> 00:42:35,679

00:42:43,640 --> 00:42:45,479
So, you're trying
to find this guy?

765
00:42:45,480 --> 00:42:47,191
Yes. Yeah.

766
00:42:47,480 --> 00:42:51,227
Well, I'm flying some radio parts
out there in five minutes.

767
00:42:53,640 --> 00:42:56,466
He may still be on the boat.

768
00:42:56,680 --> 00:42:58,027
Really?
Yeah.

769
00:42:59,040 --> 00:43:02,105
Maybe you could come with me.

770
00:43:08,320 --> 00:43:13,831
Yeah, or maybe I could just
call him on the boat phone.

771
00:43:14,520 --> 00:43:16,319
The boat phone?

772
00:43:16,320 --> 00:43:18,639
Yeah, the phone on the boat.

773
00:43:18,640 --> 00:43:21,519
You mean the ship-to-shore?

774
00:43:21,520 --> 00:43:25,239
Yeah, maybe I could just ask
him on the ship-to-shore.

775
00:43:25,240 --> 00:43:27,519
Their radio is broke.

776
00:43:27,520 --> 00:43:30,664
That's why I'm
flying out there now.

777
00:43:30,800 --> 00:43:32,101
Oh.

in, like, 40 Arabic countries.

1122
01:07:27,920 --> 01:07:30,999

in Central Asia.

1124
01:07:32,960 --> 01:07:36,264

1127
01:07:43,600 --> 01:07:47,119

<i>I was pretty close with my dad.</i>

1136
01:08:14,840 --> 01:08:19,839
And he died when I
was 17, on a Tuesday.

1137
01:08:19,840 --> 01:08:22,108
And we didn't have any savings.

1138
01:08:22,360 --> 01:08:25,879

that Thursday...

1139
01:08:25,880 --> 01:08:29,627

Walter, you got to tip these guys.

1227
01:14:15,360 --> 01:14:17,662
We got the piano back safe, Mom.

1228
01:14:18,360 --> 01:14:20,599
Are you back from your work trip?

1229
01:14:20,600 --> 01:14:22,359
Yeah, this morning.

1230
01:14:22,360 --> 01:14:23,866
Hungry?

1231
01:14:24,000 --> 01:14:25,301
Mmm-hmm.

1232
01:14:25,560 --> 01:14:27,199
I'm making soup.
Thanks.

1233
01:14:27,200 --> 01:14:29,104
Hey, tipping time now.

1234
01:14:34,720 --> 01:14:36,590
This is all I got.

1235
01:14:38,840 --> 01:14:40,479
<font color="#804040">MAN</font>: Thank you.
Thank you very much.

1236
01:14:40,480 --> 01:14:42,479
<font color="#804040">ODESSA</font>: All right,
thanks, everybody.

1237
01:14:42,480 --> 01:14:43,999
For all your hard work.

1238
01:14:44,000 --> 01:14:45,319
<font color="#804040">MAN</font>: We appreciate it, ma'am.

1239
01:14:45,320 --> 01:14:47,199
You did great.
You just let yourself out.

1240
01:14:47,200 --> 01:14:48,945
He's good for this.

1241
01:14:51,160 --> 01:14:52,879
<font color="#804040">EDNA</font>:
Are you gonna stay for dinner?

1242
01:14:52,880 --> 01:14:54,159
<font color="#804040">ODESSA</font>: Oh, Mom, I'd love to.

1243
01:14:54,160 --> 01:14:55,799
I think I'm just really wiped out

1244
01:14:55,800 --> 01:14:57,399
after supervising moving
that thing all day.

1245
01:14:57,400 --> 01:15:00,439
I think I just need to go to
yoga and then just crash.

1246
01:15:00,440 --> 01:15:02,335
What is it? A class?

1247
01:15:02,360 --> 01:15:03,559
Yes, yoga.

1248
01:15:03,560 --> 01:15:06,591
It's a class. I go to the hot
kind, where they heat the room.

1249
01:15:07,080 --> 01:15:08,719
Have you heard of that?
Sure.

1250
01:15:08,720 --> 01:15:10,839
You have?
It's great for you.

1251
01:15:10,840 --> 01:15:12,479
You just get it all
out of your system.

1252
01:15:12,480 --> 01:15:15,119
You get your sweat out, you just
get everything, all your fear.

1253
01:15:15,120 --> 01:15:17,399
I'm waiting on a call
about an audition.

1254
01:15:17,400 --> 01:15:18,799
That Grease show?

1255
01:15:18,800 --> 01:15:20,279
Yeah.
Rizzo?

1256
01:15:20,280 --> 01:15:22,628
Yeah. I'm really excited about it.

1257
01:15:23,320 --> 01:15:25,384
What's good about this is that
I just don't worry about it.

1258
01:15:25,520 --> 01:15:26,919
I just get out of my head.

1259
01:15:26,920 --> 01:15:28,039
Is that good for you?

1260
01:15:28,040 --> 01:15:30,399
I feel like it's good
in a class like this.

1261
01:15:30,400 --> 01:15:32,159
I mean, I'm not going to get
paid for it, which is fine.

1262
01:15:32,160 --> 01:15:33,879
It's not about money.
Wonderful.

1263
01:15:33,880 --> 01:15:35,599
And I feel like...

1264
01:15:35,600 --> 01:15:39,871
It's just for kids, but I think it's
important for them to start early.

1265
01:15:40,080 --> 01:15:41,479
I'm really thrilled, Mom.

1266
01:15:41,480 --> 01:15:43,599
I think I'm just
going to enjoy it.

1267
01:15:43,600 --> 01:15:45,743
Just standing in front
of people and talking.

1268
01:15:45,960 --> 01:15:48,039
You'll be good at that.
Yeah.

1269
01:15:48,040 --> 01:15:50,079
You'll really be good at that.
I think so, too, Mom.

1270
01:15:50,080 --> 01:15:51,559
Hey. Mom?

1271
01:15:51,560 --> 01:15:53,021
Yeah.

1272
01:15:53,360 --> 01:15:58,063
Did somebody take a picture of
your piano, like, a week ago?

1273
01:16:00,080 --> 01:16:01,666
I did.

1274
01:16:02,160 --> 01:16:04,269
With Sean's camera.

1275
01:16:08,120 --> 01:16:09,479
Sean O'Connell's camera?

1276
01:16:09,480 --> 01:16:11,623
Yeah, he came to visit.

1277
01:16:12,440 --> 01:16:14,105
Mom, what?

1278
01:16:14,920 --> 01:16:15,999
Yeah.

1279
01:16:16,000 --> 01:16:17,999
He wanted to know
about your work schedule,

1280
01:16:18,000 --> 01:16:20,119
when you left, when you came home.

1281
01:16:20,120 --> 01:16:22,679
He said you really
understood <i>LIFE.</i>

1282
01:16:22,680 --> 01:16:24,709
He was really
interested in your work.

1283
01:16:26,680 --> 01:16:28,319
Mom, why didn't you tell me?

1284
01:16:28,320 --> 01:16:30,999
I told you. I told you
in the produce aisle.

1285
01:16:31,000 --> 01:16:32,870
I remember that.

1286
01:16:34,160 --> 01:16:35,399
Maybe you were...

1287
01:16:35,400 --> 01:16:39,279
Odessa, what is it you call it when he
goes into one of his little places?

1288
01:16:39,280 --> 01:16:41,039
"Zoned out."

1289
01:16:41,040 --> 01:16:43,263
You do that now and then.

1290
01:16:44,800 --> 01:16:46,829
What's the matter?

1291
01:16:47,960 --> 01:16:50,069
I got fired.

1292
01:16:50,320 --> 01:16:52,349
I lost a picture of his.

1293
01:16:52,800 --> 01:16:54,101
Can you find it?

1294
01:16:55,040 --> 01:16:57,319
No, I don't know where he is.

1295
01:16:57,320 --> 01:17:00,703
He's someplace with warlocks or...

1296
01:17:01,320 --> 01:17:03,199
Warlords.

1297
01:17:03,200 --> 01:17:05,055
No, warlocks.

1298
01:17:05,080 --> 01:17:06,839
No. Warlords.

1299
01:17:06,840 --> 01:17:10,319
Sean said he had to meet
with warlords very soon...

1300
01:17:10,320 --> 01:17:12,479
and maybe he would take my cake

1301
01:17:12,480 --> 01:17:14,639
so that he could get permission...

1302
01:17:14,640 --> 01:17:17,199
to trek through
the wilds and places.

1303
01:17:17,200 --> 01:17:20,199
He said he wants to photograph
snow leopards. How about that?

1304
01:17:20,200 --> 01:17:21,945
Who?

1305
01:17:31,040 --> 01:17:33,946
"Ungoverned Afghanistan."

1306
01:17:36,600 --> 01:17:37,719
<font color="#804040">EDNA</font>: Mmm-hmm.

1307
01:17:37,720 --> 01:17:39,021
That's where Sean is.

1308
01:17:39,440 --> 01:17:42,266
Crazy Afghanistan. Yeah.

1309
01:17:42,600 --> 01:17:45,028
In the upper Himalayas.

1310
01:17:45,600 --> 01:17:47,664
They can't let you go.

1311
01:17:48,360 --> 01:17:50,639
You were Sean's partner.

1312
01:17:50,640 --> 01:17:51,959
He told me...

1313
01:17:51,960 --> 01:17:54,599
that you were the person
who worked the hardest...

1314
01:17:54,600 --> 01:17:59,349
to make sure his work was
realized the way he wished.

1315
01:18:04,280 --> 01:18:06,264
You finish his work.

1316
01:18:49,840 --> 01:18:52,159
<i>Heaven is a switchboard
that you want to fight.</i>

1317
01:18:52,160 --> 01:18:54,479
<i>She would even miss you
if you taught her sight.</i>

1318
01:18:54,480 --> 01:18:56,679
<i>Power politician leaning
to the right.</i>

1319
01:18:56,680 --> 01:18:57,999
<i>Baby's got a trust fund.</i>

1320
01:18:58,000 --> 01:19:00,999
<i>That she'll want to
go off like that.</i>

1321
01:19:01,000 --> 01:19:03,302
<i>Get off of my stack.</i>

1322
01:19:03,600 --> 01:19:05,359
<i>Leave a little window.</i>

1323
01:19:05,360 --> 01:19:07,742
<i>Get off of my stack.</i>

1324
01:19:15,680 --> 01:19:17,879
<i>Now we wear same-colored
yellow uniforms.</i>

1325
01:19:17,880 --> 01:19:20,559
<i>Sky is burning but at
least we know we're warm.</i>

1326
01:19:20,560 --> 01:19:22,679
<i>Go and run yourself
a million miles.</i>

1327
01:19:22,680 --> 01:19:24,159
<i>Hoping that the colors run out.</i>

1328
01:19:24,160 --> 01:19:26,735
<i>And you go off like that.</i>

1329
01:19:26,760 --> 01:19:29,142
<i>Get off of my stack.</i>

1330
01:19:32,040 --> 01:19:35,025

1332
01:21:47,160 --> 01:21:48,319
Hey, Todd.

1333
01:21:48,320 --> 01:21:50,159
<i>Hey, what's up?</i>

1334
01:21:50,160 --> 01:21:51,639
Not much.

1335
01:21:51,640 --> 01:21:55,439
<i>Hey, good news. Your profile
really rounded out, man.</i>

1336
01:21:55,440 --> 01:21:57,359
<i>That volcano-shark combo.</i>

1337
01:21:57,360 --> 01:22:00,479
<i>That is money in the bank. Get
ready to get a lot of winks.</i>

1338
01:22:00,480 --> 01:22:01,839
Okay.

1339
01:22:01,840 --> 01:22:03,319
<i>But something else.</i>

01:22:03,320 --> 01:22:05,319

<i>she's not on here
anymore. Withdrawn.</i>

1342
01:22:08,400 --> 01:22:09,559
Oh.

1343
01:22:09,560 --> 01:22:11,624
Really?
Yeah.

1344
01:22:11,840 --> 01:22:13,479
<i>Hey, man, where are you now?</i>

1345
01:22:13,480 --> 01:22:14,839
Himalayas.

1346
01:22:14,840 --> 01:22:18,199
<i>The Himalayas.
I love it.</i>

1347
01:22:18,200 --> 01:22:19,839
<i>That is a kick-ass
"Been There."</i>

1348
01:22:19,840 --> 01:22:22,039
Todd, I'm gonna keep this short.

1349
01:22:22,040 --> 01:22:23,839
I have to make oxygen choices.

1350
01:22:23,840 --> 01:22:26,239
<i>Hey, I get it. so!</i>

1351
01:22:26,240 --> 01:22:29,559
<i>Anyway, you have a

1352
01:22:29,560 --> 01:22:31,519
Cool, but, you know what?

1353
01:22:31,520 --> 01:22:33,239
Would you take me off?

1354
01:22:33,240 --> 01:22:36,399
I can't really swing that $500 yearly.

1355
01:22:36,400 --> 01:22:37,986
<font color="#804040">MAN</font>: Hey.

1362
01:22:51,360 --> 01:22:53,469
Todd, I got to go.

1363
01:22:55,080 --> 01:22:56,381
Sean.

1364
01:22:57,000 --> 01:22:58,381
Yeah.

1365
01:23:04,840 --> 01:23:07,188
It's Walter.

1366
01:23:10,520 --> 01:23:12,549
Mitty.

1367
01:23:21,240 --> 01:23:22,541
Walter Mitty.

1368
01:23:23,120 --> 01:23:25,070
Seriously?

1369
01:23:26,880 --> 01:23:29,387
How the hell did you get up here?

1370
01:23:29,920 --> 01:23:31,745
I just...

1371
01:23:35,080 --> 01:23:37,109
I've been looking for you.

1372
01:23:39,800 --> 01:23:41,704
Sit down.

1373
01:23:48,240 --> 01:23:49,905
I'll sit.

1374
01:23:57,600 --> 01:23:59,599
Well, take your time.
Settle in.

1375
01:23:59,600 --> 01:24:01,743
Try to be real still, okay?

1376
01:24:03,920 --> 01:24:05,790
There's a snow leopard.

1377
01:24:06,640 --> 01:24:09,466
Right in this ridge.

1378
01:24:10,000 --> 01:24:13,986
So we have to try to be very,
very, very, very still.

1379
01:24:16,800 --> 01:24:19,626
They call the snow
leopard the "ghost cat."

1380
01:24:21,320 --> 01:24:23,907
it never lets itself be seen.

1381
01:24:28,360 --> 01:24:30,662
Ghost cat?

1382
01:24:33,600 --> 01:24:37,461
Beautiful things
don't ask for attention.

1383
01:24:42,720 --> 01:24:48,265
Sean, there was a negative that
got separated from your roll.

1384
01:24:50,040 --> 01:24:53,159
I'm taking a lot of
heat over it at work.

1385
01:24:53,160 --> 01:24:57,159
It never came with the
roll that you sent.

1386
01:24:57,160 --> 01:24:59,159
The last roll
you're talking about?

1387
01:24:59,160 --> 01:25:00,439
Yeah.

1388
01:25:00,440 --> 01:25:01,821
The 25.

1389
01:25:02,960 --> 01:25:04,944
Yeah.

1390
01:25:05,840 --> 01:25:08,108
You're sitting on it.

1391
01:25:10,840 --> 01:25:13,029
Why am I sitting on it?

1392
01:25:14,160 --> 01:25:16,349
It's in your wallet.

1393
01:25:16,880 --> 01:25:19,079
That was the gift.

1394
01:25:19,080 --> 01:25:20,999
The photograph.

1395
01:25:21,000 --> 01:25:23,039
The wallet was just something
I could put it in.

1396
01:25:23,040 --> 01:25:26,679
So, I put it in a little slot, the
little picture holder in there.

1397
01:25:26,680 --> 01:25:28,630

"look inside."

inside of the wrapping paper.

nice surprise coming.

1572
01:39:39,880 --> 01:39:41,261
<i>Hi.</i>

1573
01:39:52,240 --> 01:39:54,861
Walter Mitty. Severance package.

1574
01:40:36,600 --> 01:40:38,106
Hey.

1575
01:40:38,640 --> 01:40:40,271
Cheryl.

1576
01:40:41,800 --> 01:40:43,465
Hey.
Hey.

1577
01:40:43,840 --> 01:40:46,439
I got that email
from Rich yesterday.

1578
01:40:46,440 --> 01:40:47,879
He's really good.

1579
01:40:47,880 --> 01:40:49,279
Walter, thank you.

1580
01:40:49,280 --> 01:40:50,719
That was...

1581
01:40:50,720 --> 01:40:54,039
That was just a really
cool thing to do.

1582
01:40:54,040 --> 01:40:56,342
I just saw it in Iceland.

1583
01:40:56,640 --> 01:40:57,799
He loves it.

1584
01:40:57,800 --> 01:40:59,989
And I'm taking him this afternoon.

1585
01:41:02,160 --> 01:41:04,303
Hey, I wanted you to know...

1586
01:41:04,720 --> 01:41:06,624
you weren't boring me.

1587
01:41:07,200 --> 01:41:09,025
That day in the park.

1588
01:41:10,200 --> 01:41:11,706
I was...

1589
01:41:12,800 --> 01:41:13,999
I was thinking about...

1590
01:41:14,000 --> 01:41:18,464
I hope this doesn't sound weird,
but I was thinking about you.

1591
01:41:20,080 --> 01:41:23,862
When I was in Greenland,
they do karaoke there...

1592
01:41:24,240 --> 01:41:29,626
and I had to get on this helicopter,
with a very drunk pilot.

1593
01:41:30,200 --> 01:41:33,151
And I started to imagine you...

1594
01:41:33,520 --> 01:41:35,868
singing Major Tom.

1595
01:41:38,360 --> 01:41:40,310
Anyway...

1596
01:41:40,920 --> 01:41:43,279
it got me on the helicopter.

1597
01:41:43,280 --> 01:41:47,665
And it got me
where I wanted to go.

1598
01:41:49,880 --> 01:41:51,079
So, what happened to you?

1599
01:41:51,080 --> 01:41:54,439
You sort of fell off the
face of the Earth there.

1600
01:41:54,440 --> 01:41:56,185
For a little bit.

1601
01:41:56,520 --> 01:41:58,879
I came by and...

1602
01:41:58,880 --> 01:42:01,990
your husband answered so I
figured I should just go.

1603
01:42:03,080 --> 01:42:06,559
Phil. He was
fixing my refrigerator.

1604
01:42:06,560 --> 01:42:08,669
And he's not my husband.

1605
01:42:09,760 --> 01:42:12,028
I guess I imagined...

1606
01:42:13,600 --> 01:42:16,187
I thought maybe you
got back together.

1607
01:42:16,600 --> 01:42:18,879
You have a good imagination.

1608
01:42:18,880 --> 01:42:20,705
But no.

1609
01:42:22,960 --> 01:42:25,719
Hey, my sister got
this role in Grease.

1610
01:42:25,720 --> 01:42:27,079
Rizzo.

1611
01:42:27,080 --> 01:42:29,747
Not on Broadway.
In some weird church.

1612
01:42:32,400 --> 01:42:34,270
Do you want to go with me?

1613
01:42:35,000 --> 01:42:36,759
I made that sound really not good.

1614
01:42:36,760 --> 01:42:38,266
Yeah.

1615
01:42:38,840 --> 01:42:40,380
Yeah?

1616
01:42:40,400 --> 01:42:43,599
Yeah, yeah.
I would love to.

1617
01:42:43,600 --> 01:42:46,599
Grease in a weird church?
Are you kidding?

1618
01:42:46,600 --> 01:42:49,062
Rizzo, that's the best part.

1619
01:42:49,080 --> 01:42:52,159
Yeah, Rizzo. <font color="#808080">(CHUCKLES)</font>
Tough and tender.

1620
01:42:52,160 --> 01:42:53,905
Yeah.

1621
01:42:54,400 --> 01:42:56,065
Great.

1622
01:42:56,480 --> 01:42:58,987
Are you heading Uptown?

1623
01:42:59,360 --> 01:43:00,439
Sure.

1624
01:43:00,440 --> 01:43:01,741
Yeah?

1625
01:43:03,520 --> 01:43:05,759
I actually always
related to Rizzo more.

1626
01:43:05,760 --> 01:43:07,439
Oh, yeah?
Yeah.

1627
01:43:07,440 --> 01:43:10,679
Was it the smoking
and the teenage sex?

1628
01:43:10,680 --> 01:43:13,759
No. She was just real, I guess.

1629
01:43:13,760 --> 01:43:14,999
Oh!

1630
01:43:15,000 --> 01:43:18,463
The last issue, it should be here.
It came out this morning.

1631
01:43:38,960 --> 01:43:41,581
Man. Walter.

1632
01:44:00,000 --> 01:44:02,519
Should we go buy one of those?

1633
01:44:02,520 --> 01:44:04,439
Yeah. I was probably gonna...

1634
01:44:04,440 --> 01:44:06,279
Probably gonna go back later?
Yeah.

1635
01:44:06,280 --> 01:44:10,301
I just didn't want to seem
uncool and get one right away.

1636
01:44:41,720 --> 01:44:45,467
<i>There's a rhythm
in rush these days.</i>

1637
01:44:47,680 --> 01:44:51,871
<i>Where the lines don't move
and the colors don't fade.</i>

1638
01:44:54,640 --> 01:44:58,387
<i>Leaves you empty
with nothing but dreams.</i>

1639
01:45:00,680 --> 01:45:04,871
<i>In a world gone shallow
In a world gone lean.</i>

1640
01:45:07,600 --> 01:45:11,507
<i>Sometimes there's things
a man cannot know.</i>

1641
01:45:14,040 --> 01:45:17,822
<i>The gears won't turn
and the leaves won't grow.</i>

1642
01:45:20,400 --> 01:45:24,546
<i>There's no place to run
and no gasoline.</i>

1643
01:45:26,960 --> 01:45:30,548
<i>Engine won't turn
And the train won't leave.</i>

1644
01:45:33,400 --> 01:45:37,785
<i>Engines won't turn
And the train won't leave.</i>

1645
01:45:39,760 --> 01:45:43,382
<i>I will stay with you tonight.</i>

1646
01:45:46,240 --> 01:45:50,226
<i>Hold you close
'til the morning light.</i>

1647
01:45:52,560 --> 01:45:56,501
<i>In the morning watch
a new day rise.</i>

1648
01:45:59,120 --> 01:46:03,141
<i>We'll do whatever
just to stay alive.</i>

1649
01:46:05,520 --> 01:46:09,666
<i>We'll do whatever
just to stay alive.</i>

1650
01:46:11,760 --> 01:46:15,587
<i>Well, the way I feel is
the way I write.</i>

1651
01:46:17,680 --> 01:46:21,541
<i>Racin' like the thoughts
of the man who lies.</i>

1652
01:46:23,160 --> 01:46:26,703
<i>There is a truth and
it's on our side.</i>

1653
01:46:28,640 --> 01:46:32,342
<i>Dawn is coming
Open your eyes.</i>

1654
01:46:34,360 --> 01:46:38,301
<i>Look into the sun
as the new days rise.</i>

1655
01:46:39,800 --> 01:46:43,547
<i>And I will wait
for you tonight.</i>

1656
01:46:45,280 --> 01:46:49,380
<i>You're here forever
and you're by my side.</i>

1657
01:46:50,680 --> 01:46:54,826
<i>I've been waiting all my life.</i>

1658
01:46:56,320 --> 01:47:00,466
<i>To feel your heart
as it's keeping time.</i>

1659
01:47:02,000 --> 01:47:06,191
<i>We'll do whatever
just to stay alive.</i>

1660
01:47:23,240 --> 01:47:26,703
<i>Dawn is coming
Open your eyes.</i>

1661
01:47:30,560 --> 01:47:34,307
<i>Dawn is coming
Open your eyes.</i>

1662
01:47:37,960 --> 01:47:42,151
<i>Dawn is coming
Open your eyes.</i>

1663
01:47:45,360 --> 01:47:49,904
<i>Dawn is coming
Open your eyes.</i>

1664
01:48:00,160 --> 01:48:05,102
<i>Look into the sun
as the new days rise.</i>

1665
01:48:09,400 --> 01:48:13,182
<i>There's a rhythm
in rush these days.</i>

1666
01:48:15,400 --> 01:48:19,591
<i>Where the lines don't move
and the colors don't fade.</i>

1667
01:48:22,240 --> 01:48:26,022
<i>Leaves you empty
with nothing but dreams.</i>

1668
01:48:28,280 --> 01:48:32,585
<i>In a world gone shallow
In a world gone lean.</i>

1669
01:48:35,240 --> 01:48:38,783
<i>But there is a truth
and it's on our side.</i>

1670
01:48:41,720 --> 01:48:45,263
<i>Dawn is coming, open your eyes.</i>

1671
01:48:48,240 --> 01:48:52,750
<i>Look into the sun
as a new days rise.</i>

1672
01:49:02,520 --> 01:49:05,664
<i>Step outside,
I'm gonna step outside.</i>

1673
01:49:09,160 --> 01:49:12,509
<i>Step outside,
I'm gonna step outside.</i>

1674
01:49:25,960 --> 01:49:29,264
<i>Heart's on fire,
leave it all behind you.</i>

1675
01:49:39,160 --> 01:49:42,862
<i>Dark as night,
let the lightning guide you.</i>

1676
01:49:49,280 --> 01:49:52,345
<i>Step outside,
I'm gonna step outside.</i>

1677
01:49:59,160 --> 01:50:02,907
<i>Heart's on fire,
leave it all behind you.</i>

1678
01:50:03,320 --> 01:50:09,229
<i>Living life
Feeding appetites.</i>

1679
01:50:09,760 --> 01:50:15,590
<i>Stake through every heart
stop in the mood.</i>

1680
01:50:16,680 --> 01:50:19,381
<i>Being glad.</i>

1681
01:50:19,840 --> 01:50:23,110
<i>Breathing half the time.</i>

1682
01:50:32,560 --> 01:50:36,103
<i>Heart's on fire,
leave it all behind you.</i>

1683
01:50:45,520 --> 01:50:49,279
<i>Dark as night,
let the lightning guide you.</i>

1684
01:50:49,280 --> 01:50:52,151
<i>Step outside,
I'm gonna step outside.</i>

1685
01:51:19,480 --> 01:51:22,759
<i>Broke to Monday.</i>

1686
01:51:22,760 --> 01:51:25,427
<i>Something's not the same.</i>

1687
01:51:26,080 --> 01:51:28,079
<i>Blank head.</i>

1688
01:51:28,080 --> 01:51:31,065
<i>Cross tiles sweep the floor.</i>

1689
01:51:32,720 --> 01:51:37,759
<i>Feel your presence
in your absence.</i>

1690
01:51:37,760 --> 01:51:39,585
<i>Shut the door.</i>

1691
01:51:48,560 --> 01:51:52,262
<i>Heart's on fire,
leave it all behind you.</i>

1692
01:52:01,840 --> 01:52:05,508
<i>Dark as night,
let the lightning guide you.</i>

1693
01:52:08,240 --> 01:52:11,839
<i>Must believe in.</i>

1694
01:52:11,840 --> 01:52:14,879
<i>Step outside
Take a step outside.</i>

1695
01:52:14,880 --> 01:52:16,784
<i>Take a step outside.</i>

1696
01:52:21,560 --> 01:52:25,119
<i>Must believe in.</i>

1697
01:52:25,120 --> 01:52:28,159
<i>Step outside
Take a step outside.</i>

1698
01:52:28,160 --> 01:52:30,064
<i>Take a step outside.</i>

1699
01:52:35,320 --> 01:52:38,988
<i>Heart's on fire,
leave it all behind you.</i>

1700
01:53:06,120 --> 01:53:08,787
<i>You know I love my lady.</i>

1701
01:53:09,800 --> 01:53:12,228
<i>We've been together so long.</i>

1702
01:53:13,360 --> 01:53:16,140
<i>Like a worn-out recording.</i>

1703
01:53:17,120 --> 01:53:19,229
<i>Of my favorite song.</i>

1704
01:53:20,400 --> 01:53:23,146
<i>So while she lay there sleepin'.</i>

1705
01:53:24,000 --> 01:53:26,223
<i>I read the paper in bed.</i>

1706
01:53:27,480 --> 01:53:30,351
<i>And in the personal columns,</i>

1707
01:53:31,040 --> 01:53:33,263
<i>There was this letter
that read.</i>

1708
01:53:34,640 --> 01:53:37,671
<i>If you like piña coladas.</i>

1709
01:53:38,280 --> 01:53:40,628
<i>Or getting caught in the rain.</i>

1710
01:53:42,040 --> 01:53:44,741
<i>And the feel of the ocean.</i>

1711
01:53:45,560 --> 01:53:48,022
<i>And the taste of champagne.</i>

1712
01:53:48,880 --> 01:53:51,581
<i>If you like making love
at midnight.</i>

1713
01:53:52,560 --> 01:53:55,022
<i>In the dunes of the cape.</i>

1714
01:53:55,960 --> 01:53:58,991
<i>Then you're the lady
that I look for.</i>

1715
01:53:59,760 --> 01:54:02,142
<i>Come with me and escape</i>
